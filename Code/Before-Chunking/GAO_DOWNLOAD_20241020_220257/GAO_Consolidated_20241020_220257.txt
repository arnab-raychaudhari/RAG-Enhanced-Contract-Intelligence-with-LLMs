RURAL DEVELOPMENT  
Actions Needed to Improve Assistance to Southwest 
Border Communities Known as Colonias  
What GAO Found 
Colonias —predominately rural, Hispanic communities near the U.S. -Mexico 
border —face a range of economic, infrastructure, and environmental challenges . 
For example, regions with colonias have poverty rates 3 to 9 percentage points 
higher than other border regions.  Further, h ousing values in areas with colonias 
are generally lower than those in the other border regions of each state, while the 
vacan cy rates  are generally higher.  
Five Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) and U.S. 
Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) programs  provide grants and loans targeted 
specifically to  colonias  to improve water  and wastewater  systems and housing.  
However, USDA’s Single Family Housing programs  do not have a process for 
identifying applications for projects in colonias . As a result , the agency  does not 
have reliable  data on the extent to which its programs are benefiting  colonias, 
and aligning with agency and statutory goals for supporting these communities . 
Many colonias face challenges in obtaining and using federal assistance. For 
example, l ocal governments may not have the staff capacity to apply for some 
federal ly funded programs. In addition, the rural nature of these communities 
often makes it expensive to connect to existing infrastructure. To help address 
these challenges , HUD and USDA  offer technical assistance and grants.  
Due to population changes, nearly 60 percent of colonias will likely become 
ineligible in the future for certain targeted financial assistance. By statu te, U.S. -
Mexico border states must set aside a percentage of their HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for colonias located within 
metropolitan statistical areas  of 1 million persons or less. However, many 
colonias are now part of areas that likely will soon exceed this threshold.  This 
would render them ineligible for the set -aside , even though many of these areas 
continue to have rural characteristics.  Revising the population requirement could 
help preserve eligibility for many communities that were originally intended to 
benefit from  the set-aside.

Colonias generally refer to rural 
communities in the border regions of 
Arizona, California, New Mexico, and 
Texas that are characterized by 
substandard housing and lack of 
access to adequate water and 
wastewater infrastructure. The Joint 
Explanatory Statement  accompanying 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2023 includ es a provision for GAO to 
review the conditions of colonias  and 
issues related to  federal assistance 
available to them . 
This report examines  conditions in 
colonias,  the federal assistance 
available to them , and challenges  they 
may face in obtaining and using  federal 
assistance.  GAO analyzed American 
Community Survey data  and reviewed 
USDA and HUD program 
documentation and funding data for 
fiscal years 2020 –2023. GAO also 
interview ed representatives of federal 
agencies, state governments, and 
interest groups . GAO made physical 
observations and conducted interviews 
with local officials during site visits to 
24 colonias in the four  U.S. -Mexico  
border states.  
What GAO Recommends  
Congress should consider revising the 
population  requirement for colonias to 
receive CDBG set-aside funding given 
population growth in the Southwest . 
GAO is also mak ing two  
recommendations to USDA , including 
that it develop procedures to identify 
applications for  Single  Family Housing 
assistance for projects in colonias . 
USDA agreed with both 
recommendations.

Colonias have historically been characterized as rural communities with a 
majority Hispanic/Latino population and high rates of poverty. Although 
there is no universally accepted definition of “colonias, ” in the United 
States the term generally refers to communities along the U.S.-Mexico border with substandard housing and lack of access to adequate water 
and wastewater infrastructure.
1 According to the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD), as of 2010 there were over 2,000 
communities designated as colonias across Arizona, California, New 
Mexico, and Texas.2 
Several pieces of legislation were enacted in the early 1990s to help 
address conditions in colonias. For example, the Cranston-Gonzalez 
National Affordable Housing Act directed the U.S.-Mexico border states to 
set aside a percentage of their annual state Community Development

housing activities in colonias, as defined by law.3 
The Joint Explanatory Statement to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2023 includes a provision for us to review conditions of and federal assistance for colonias, along with how federal agencies define colonias.
4 
This report (1) describes conditions in colonias, (2) examines federal 
assistance available to colonias, and (3) examines challenges that may 
affect colonias in obtaining and using federal assistance and federal 
efforts to mitigate those challenges.  
To address all objectives, we visited 24 colonias in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas to observe conditions and projects funded by federal programs. Within each state, we selected colonias that were in 
both incorporated and unincorporated areas and that reflected a variety of 
types and amounts of federal funding, among other criteria. Information 
we obtained from these site visits is not generalizable to all colonias. 
Additionally, we interviewed federal, state, and local government officials 
and representatives from national and local nonprofit organizations who 
work in colonias.  
For our first objective, we analyzed 2010 HUD and University of New 
Mexico geospatial data on colonias and 2020 Census Bureau data to 
determine in which census tracts colonias were located. We then 
analyzed data from the 2017– 2021 American Community Survey  to 
compare economic and housing conditions in these census tracts with 
others in the border regions of each state. Additionally, we analyzed data 
sets from relevant federal agencies to describe the environmental risk of 
heat, wildfires, flooding, and hurr icane storm surge in census tracts with 
colonias.

5All these data sources represented the most recent available data. To assess the 
reliability of these data, we interviewed federal officials knowledgeable about the data, reviewed existing information on the data and the system that produced them, and 
reviewed a GAO data reliability assessment for another  report using the data, among 
other things. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing 
conditions in colonias.

Page 3  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  For our second objective, we reviewed laws and regulations and agency 
materials. We then established and applied criteria to determine which 
federal programs provided targeted assistance to colonias. For each 
targeted program, we analyzed agency documentation on how funds can 
be used and obtained annual obligations from fiscal years 2020 through 
2023.6 We also analyzed legislation, regulations , and additional agency 
information on eligibility criteria for each program and summarized site 
visit observations of projects funded with targeted programs. In addition, 
we assessed U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Single Family 
Housing processes  against statutory and agency requirements. 
For our third objective, we reviewed relevant literature and interviewed the parties described above, as well as recipients of funding from programs that provide targeted assistance to colonias. We also observed 
evidence of challenges faced by colonias, as  well as actions that had 
been undertaken to address these challenges. To determine the potential 
effect of population changes on communities’ eligibility for targeted 
programs, we reviewed statutory and regulatory eligibility requirements 
that apply to colonias for HUD and USDA programs, and we analyzed 
geographic data from HUD on the communities that are currently eligible 
as colonias under its definition. In the interviews described above, we 
discussed federal efforts to collaborate across agencies and w ith local 
governments and to mitigate challenges to obtaining funding. 
See appendix I for more detailed information on our scope and 
methodology. 
We conducted this performance audit from March 2023 to September 
2024 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for 
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe 
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings 
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  
 
 
 
6An obligation is a definite commitment that creates a legal liability of the United States 
government for the payment of goods or services, or a legal duty on the part of the United 
States government that could mature into a legal liability. An agency incurs an obligation, for example, when it signs a grant or loan agreement,

The history of the development of colonias varies among the border 
states, with some colonias dating back over a century. For example, some colonias in New Mexico began as settlements associated with early 
U.S. military forts and Catholic missionary activities. Colonias in California 
were established before 1929, when subdivision laws went into effect in 
the state, according to one study.
7 
However, the development of colonias began to accelerate in the mid-
20th century. For example, colonias emerged in Texas around the 1950s, 
when developers began subdividing agriculturally valueless land in unincorporated areas and selling it to individuals  looking for affordable 
housing. These developers could subdivide and sell this land as residential without providing basic infrastructure because, at the time, county governments in Texas could not regulate the subdivision of land 
outside the jurisdiction of city governments, according to a government 
report.
8 Additionally, colonias referred to as “wildcat subdivisions ” 
emerged in Arizona in the 1950s, established by individuals who did not 
understand or wish to follow government regulations.  
Present-day colonias are communities of all types and sizes, both 
incorporated and unincorporated. They include high-poverty subdivisions, 
retirement communities, and tribal reservations. These communities are found throughout the border region, with the majority concentrated in 
Texas (see fig. 1). Communities are designated as colonias via a process 
that varies by state and generally involves an act of local government, such as a resolution by a County Board of Commissioners.

Note: The figure reflects the location of colonias included in Department of Housing and Urban 
Development or University of New Mexico data as of 2010. 
 
Legislation in the early 1990s established a set-aside and preference 
within new and existing federal programs for colonias. This targeted assistance is administered by HUD and USDA. For example, the 
Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, as am ended, 
established a set-aside for colonias that directs HUD to provide grants to 
colonias using funds that may be made available through the CDBG State 
Program. In addition, legislation established targeted assistance for 
colonias through USDA ’s Rural Development grant and loan programs. 
To be eligible for the targeted assistance through these programs, a community must meet the applicable program’ s specific definition of a 
colonia, which can vary. However, all of these programs require that a 
community demonstrate lack of potable water systems, adequate sewage 
systems, and safe and sanitary housing.

According to our analysis, areas with colonias were generally more 
economically disadvantaged than other border regions of each state in 
2017– 2021.
9 
• Poverty. In all four border states, the percent of families in areas with 
colonias living below the poverty level was about 3 to 9 percentage points higher than in the other border regions.
10 
• Employment. In California and Texas, unemployment rates of the population age 16 and older in areas with colonias were about 2 to 3 percentage points higher than in the other border regions of these 
 
9These estimates are based on the American Community Survey ’s 2017 –2021 5-year 
data. In our analysis, unless otherwise stated, areas with colonias are all census tracts in 
each border state that contain one or more colonias included in Department of Housing and Urban Development or University of New Mexico data as of 2010. The other border 
regions of each state are all census tracts within 150 miles of the U.S. -Mexico border 
excluding census tracts that contain one or more colonias or are in metropolitan statistical 
areas with a population exceeding 1 million.  
10The Census Bureau uses money income thresholds that vary by family size and 
composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family ’s total income is less than the 
associated income threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty.  Areas with Colonias

statistically different than in the other border regions.12 
• Educational attainment. In all four border states, the percent of the 
population age 25 and older with less than a high school education 
was about 7 to 15 percentage points higher in areas with colonias 
than in the other border regions. Research has found that lower 
educational attainment is generally correlated with both lower 
earnings and higher unemployment rates.13 
See figure 2 for more information on how areas with colonias compare 
with other border regions and the state overall in terms of these economic characteristics.  
 
11According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, individuals age 16 and older are considered 
employed if they have worked at least 1 hour in the last 4 weeks for themselves or as a 
paid employee or were temporarily on leave, and unemployed if they are not working but 
have actively looked for work within the last 4 weeks.  
12The unemployment rate of communities with low labor force participation may not reflect 
the true rate of unemployment because certain populations are not counted as 
unemployed— such as individuals not participating in the labor force. To be considered 
participating in the labor force, an individual must either be employed or have been 
actively looking for work within the last week. We found that in areas with colonias, the percentage of the population age 16 and older who were in the labor force was 3 to 23 
percentage points lower than in other border regions, and that labor force participation in 
areas with colonias was statistically different from other border regions in all four border states. Individuals in low -income communities generally face greater barriers to 
employment —such as lack of transportation and childcare —that may discourage them 
from pursuing employment opportunities. See Kelly Edmiston, “Why Aren ’t More People 
Working in Low - and Moderate-Income Areas?, ” Economic Review (Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas, 2019).

According to our analysis, certain housing characteristics in areas with 
colonias differed from those in the other border regions of each state in 
2017– 2021:14

Page 9  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  in areas with colonias than in the other border regions.15 Mobile 
homes may be more common in these areas because they are 
generally more affordable than site- built housing.16 See figure 3 for 
examples of housing types we observed on our site visits to the four 
border states. 
 
15While the term “mobile home” is often used colloquially, HUD has used the term 
“manufactured home” since 1980 to refer to a “mobile home. ” See Pub. L. No. 96-399, § 
308(c)(4), 94 Stat. 1641 (1980), amending Pub. L. No. 106-569, 88 Stat. 700 (1974) 
(modifying the term “mobile home” to “manufactured home” in the National Manufactured 
Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, which established federal construction and safety standards for mobile homes). To be considered a manufactured 
home (formerly a mobile home), the dwelling must meet federal manufactured home 
constructi on and safety standards, which are regulated and enforced by HUD. 42 U.S.C. 
§§ 5401- 5426, 24 C.F.R. pts. 3280, 3282.  
16Site-built housing is constructed at permanent locations, whereas a manufactured home 
(i.e., a mobile home) is prefabricated housing that is assembled in factories and then 
transported to sites of use. According to the Census Bureau, the average sales pric e of a 
new manufactured home in 2023 was around $124,300, while the average sales price of a 
new site- built home was $514,000.

• Housing value. In all four border states, the percent of housing units 
valued below $100,000 was about 11 to 20 percentage points higher 
in areas with colonias than in the other border regions. This difference may be explained, in part, by areas with colonias having a 
higher percentage of inexpensive housing types, such as mobile 
homes.

Page 11 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  • Housing age. In California, New Mexico, and Texas, the percent of 
housing units built in 1990 or later was about 5 to 30 percentage 
points higher in areas with colonias than in the other border regions of these states. In Arizona, the percent of housing units built in 1990 or later in areas with colonias  was not statistically different from the 
other border regions. Targeted federal assistance to colonias started 
to become available in the early 1990s, which may help explain an 
increase in development in these areas.

with colonias.

Page 12  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Certain occupancy characteristics of housing in areas with colonias also 
differed from those in the other border regions in each state in 2017–
2021:17 
• Owner -occupancy. In all four border states, the percent of owner -
occupied housing units was about 5 to 15 percentage points higher in areas with colonias than in the other border regions. Research has 
found that residents of colonias may use unconventional financing—
such as contracts for deed—to buy a home because low -income 
individuals often do not qualify for conventional financing.
18 
• Vacancy. In Arizona, California, and New Mexico, the percent of 
vacant housing units was about 5 to 16 percentage points higher in areas with colonias than in the other border regions in each state. In 
Texas, the percent of vacant housing units in areas with colonias was 
not statistically different from the border regions.
19 In colonias, 
properties may be vacant for various reasons —for example, a 
property owner may have moved but not have sold the property due to a lack of available financing in these areas.
20 
• Overcrowding. In Arizona and Texas, the percent of housing units 
that were overcrowded was about 2 to 5 percentage points higher in areas with colonias than in the other border regions.
21 In California 
and New Mexico, overcrowding in areas with colonias was not 
statistically different than in the border regions. Research has found 
that overcrowding often stems from a lack  of affordable housing. For 
 
17These estimates are based on the American Community Survey ’s 2017 –2021 5-year 
data.  
18Some colonia residents have purchased their homes through an unconventional 
financing mechanism called a contract for deed. Through a contract for deed, the 
purchase of a property is financed by the seller, rather than through a third- party lender 
such as a commercial bank. Under this arrangement, the buyer takes immediate 
possession of the property, often paying little or nothing down, but the seller retains the 
legal title to the property until the buyer has paid off the purchase price. See Peter M. 
Ward,  Heather K. Way, and Lucille Wood, The Contract for Deed Prevalence Project: A 
Final Report to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs  (August 2012).  
19According to the American Community Survey, a housing unit is considered vacant if no 
one is living there at the time of the interview.

do not contain one or more colonias. 
 
Colonias have historically lacked access to adequate infrastructure and 
services, such as water and wastewater. Colonias were often built in 
unincorporated areas where developers were able to sell property as residential without providing basic infrastructure. In the early 1990s, 
federal efforts began to address the infrastructure needs of these 
communities.

Page 14  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  The majority of colonias in the four border states are now served by some 
form of water and wastewater infrastructure. According to a federally 
funded needs assessment conducted by the Rural Community Assistance 
Partnership in 2015, about 95 percent of these colonias were served by 
some form of water infrastructure (i.e., a public water system or a private 
well). About 71 percent were served by some form of wastewater 
infrastructure (i.e., a public or private sewer or septic system).23 
However, not all the colonias served by water and wastewater 
infrastructure had adequate service. The 2015 needs assessment found that about 12 percent of colonias had inadequate water service and about 
17 percent had inadequate wastewater service.
24 Local officials we spoke 
with in all four states also highlighted inadequacies of the water and 
wastewater infrastructure serving some colonias in their regions. For 
example, local officials in California stated that water infrastructure 
serving colonias is often connected to more households than it is designed to serve, leading to insufficient water supply to these 
communities. 
 
23Rural Community Assistance Partnership, U.S. -Mexico Border Needs Assessment and 
Support Project: Phase II Assessment Report  (2015). This study was a follow -up to an 
initial report by USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency that assessed the water 
and wastewater needs of selected colonias by analyzing publicly available data. The initial 
report assessed counties with 10 or  more colonias —which together contained more than 
95 percent of designated colonias —as well as selected counties in each state with fewer 
than 10 colonias. See U.S. Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Mexico Border Needs Assessment and Support Project: Phase 1 Scoping 
Assessment Report (2014).  
In 2014, USDA awarded the Rural Community Assistance Partnership with a grant to 
conduct the follow -up report that would validate the findings of the initial report by 
conducting an in-depth assessment of the water and wastewater infrastructure in these 
selected colonias. The colonias assessed in this follow -up report may not be the same as 
the colonias that we analyzed for our report because the follow -up report assessed (1) 
communities that met the definition of colonias under USDA regulation, whereas we analyzed colonias included in Department of Housing and Urban Development or 
University of New Mexico data as of 2010, and (2) only colonias in selected counties, 
whereas we analyzed all colonias included the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development or University of New Mexico data as of 2010.  
24The needs assessment defines a colonia with inadequate access to water infrastructure 
as a community served by a public water system, private wells, or a combination of both, 
but with inadequate quantity or quality of source water. It defines a colonia wit h 
inadequate access to wastewater infrastructure as a community served by a public sewer, private sewer, onsite septic system, or combination thereof, but where Rural Community 
Assistance Partnership staff determined that the service was inadequate.  

[Extract from GAO_PDF_20241020_220257.pdf - Page 20]
 
     
Page 15  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Additionally, the 2015 needs assessment found that about 5 percent of 
colonias did not have any access to water infrastructure and about 29 
percent did not have any access to wastewater infrastructure.25 During 
our site visits, we observed several colonias that were unserved by either 
water or wastewater infrastructure. For example, we observed a colonia 
in Texas where residents obtained water by hauling and storing it in a 
cistern on their property (see fig. 6). A county official stated it was not 
economically feasible to extend water infrastructure to some colonias, 
given their distance from existing water systems.  
 
25The needs assessment defines a colonia with no access to water infrastructure as a 
community where Rural Community Assistance Partnership staff could not identify a water 
source, or whose residents are known to haul water. It defines a colonia with no access to 
wastewater infrastructure as a community where Rural Community Assistance Partnership 
staff could not identify any permitted wastewater infrastructure.

Local officials in all four states also noted other infrastructure and 
services that were either inadequate or unavailable in some colonias. 
Officials from three states stated that inadequate stormwater drainage 
infrastructure was a concern. Local officials also said some colonias lacked streetlighting, sidewalks, animal control, and trash service. For 
example, a local official in Texas said many colonia residents lacked 
municipal trash service, which could make trash difficult to dispose of and lead to illegal dumping by residents and local businesses (see fig. 7).

Local officials in all four states expressed concern that some colonias ’ 
sources of drinking water may be at risk of contamination for the following 
reasons:  
• Failing infrastructure. Officials from all four states said some 
colonias were at risk of water contamination because of water or wastewater infrastructure that was failing due to age or poor

Page 18  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  maintenance. For example, officials from Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Texas said that septic systems —which many colonias rely on for 
wastewater service—are often poorly or improperly maintained and can risk contaminating groundwater if the tanks begin to leak.  
• Industry. Officials from Arizona and New Mexico said some colonias 
experienced groundwater contamination from local industry, such as 
agriculture and mining. For example, groundwater in several New 
Mexico colonias was contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from nearby copper and iron mines. 
• Runoff from Mexico. Officials from Arizona and California said 
colonias in their state that are close to the border are at risk of water 
contamination from Mexico. For example, the Salton Sea—around 
which several of California’ s colonias are located—is routinely 
contaminated by agricultural runoff and untreated waste carried in from Mexico on the New River. 
Additionally, areas with colonias in all four states are at risk of being 
affected by certain natural hazards:  
• Heat and drought. According to our analysis of federal climate data, 
areas with colonias in the four border states are projected to 
experience an average of between 39 to 48 more days annually with a 
high temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit by midcentury (see fig. 8).
26 Extreme heat can have negative effects on human health, 
such as temperature-related illnesses and death, and these effects 
can be particularly acute for populations without access to air 
conditioning. For example, a state official in California said there have 
been heat-related deaths in colonias because residents either did not have air conditioning or could afford to run it.  
 
26This estimate refers to the projected change in annual number of days with a maximum 
temperature over 90 degrees Fahrenheit by midcentury (i.e., 2036– 2065), using both a 
low-emission and a high- emission scenario for projected climate change from the U.S. 
Global Change Research Program ’s fourth National Climate Assessment.

Midcentury  
 
Note: This figure represents the projected change in annual days with a maximum temperature over 
90 degrees Fahrenheit by midcentury (i.e., 2036–2065) using a low-emission scenario for projected climate change from the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s fourth National Climate Assessment. The figure represents these estimates only for census tracts that we identified as containing one or more colonias. 
 
Higher average temperatures may also exacerbate other natural 
hazards, such as drought.27 Since 2000, the southwestern United 
States has been experiencing its driest period in the last 1,200 years, 
and these conditions have contributed to reduced surface and 
groundwater availability, according to a 2023 study.28 An official in 
Texas told us that colonias have experienced water service 
disruptions when water levels of the Rio Grande River —the area’ s 
sole surface -water source—have become too low due to drought. 
 
27We did not analyze drought data because we were unable to identify national -level 
geospatial data that were both relevant to areas with colonias and sufficiently reliable for 
our purposes.

Page 20  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  • Wildfire. Increasing temperatures and drought conditions also 
contribute to increases in wildfire frequency. According to our analysis 
of U.S. Forest Service data, about 61 percent of areas with colonias 
across all four border states are at some level of risk of wildfire, with about 26 percent having a high or very high risk (see fig. 9).
29 Around 
1,300 colonias are in areas at some risk of wildfire, with about 400 in 
areas at high or very high risk, according to our analysis.  
Wildfires can directly endanger people and property, as well as 
indirectly affecting human health by degrading water and air quality. 
County officials in Arizona stated that fire services face challenges extinguishing fires quickly in some colonias because they are remote 
or do not have fire hydrants.  
 
 
29The Forest Service maps wildfire hazard potential based on landscape conditions and 
other observations. These maps include an index of wildfire hazard potential for the United 
States, based on, among other factors, annual burn probabilities and potential i ntensity of 
large fires. The Forest Service categorizes the wildfire hazard potential index into five 
classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The Forest Service designates as 
“high” those areas with a wildfire hazard potential index from the 85th to the 95th 
percentile,  and as “very high” those areas above the 95th percentile. For this analysis, we 
combined the high and very high wildfire hazard potential categories.

bThe Forest Service designates as “high” those areas with wildfire hazard potential index from the 
85th to the 95th percentile, and as “very high” those areas above the 95th percentile. 
 
• Flooding. According to our analysis of Federal Emergency 
Management Agency data, about 95 percent of areas with colonias in 
Arizona, California, and New Mexico are at high risk of flooding (see 
fig. 10).30 All the areas with colonias that were at low risk of flooding 
were in California. About 173 colonias were in areas at high risk of flooding, according to our analysis.  
 
30We analyzed Federal Emergency Management Agency data from 2023. For our 
analysis, high flood hazard corresponds to areas in 100-year floodplains (areas with a 1 
percent or higher annual chance of flooding). In New Mexico, we were unable to map five 
census tracts due to lack of intersecting flood plain data. Tracts were excluded if 90 
percent of the tract did not have floodplain coverage.

Note: This figure represents these estimates only for census tracts that we identified as containing 
one or more colonias. 
 
There was not sufficient data on flood hazards along the U.S.-Mexico 
border in Texas for us to analyze the overall flood risk to colonias.31 
However, local officials in Texas told us that flooding was a concern 
for colonias in their region. For example, in Cameron County, Texas —
which is bordered by the Rio Grande River in the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the east—170 of the county ’s 174 colonias are in areas 
at high risk for flooding.  
Flooding can cause damage to property and infrastructure, water quality concerns, and human health hazards. For example, local 
officials from a city adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border told us that 
flash flooding can bring stormwater laden with trash and other pollutants into Arizona from Mexico. They said this runoff affects the entire city, including many colonias.  
• Hurricanes.  According to our analysis of National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration data, about 9 percent of areas with 
colonias across all four border states are at risk of a hurricane. All of 
 
31We did not assess flood risk in Texas because over 50 percent of tracts in Texas did not 
intersect with any flood hazard areas, which means we could not assess the extent to 
which they were at risk of flooding.

Page 23 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  the areas at risk were in the Gulf Coast area of Texas (see fig. 11).32 
About 126 colonias were in this area, according to our analysis.  
High winds from hurricanes can cause damage to property and 
infrastructure, and the storm surge from hurricanes can cause 
flooding. County officials in Texas noted that some colonias are built in low -lying areas that are particularly prone to flooding, and that 
these communities are especially vulnerable to natural hazards such as hurricanes.

32Our analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration storm surge data is 
based on a model that estimates the maximum extent of storm surge at high tide. The 
agency provides estimates of hurricane storm surge using a model called Sea, Lake, and 
Overland Surges from Hurricanes. This model includes hypothetical hurricanes under 
different storm conditions, such as landfall location, trajectory, and forward speed.

Page 24 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Additionally, many colonias have certain socioeconomic characteristics —
such as a higher prevalence of poverty, unemployment, and low 
educational attainment—that may affect their ability to prepare for and 
respond to natural hazards.33 
For additional information on economic, housing, and environmental 
characteristics in areas with colonias in each state, see appendix II.  
 
  
 
   
Five federal programs provided targeted funding to colonias from fiscal years 2020 through 2023 for water, wastewater, and housing needs. The 
funds were provided to colonias via a dedicated funding set- aside, a 
funding preference, or both. As seen in table 1, these programs were 
HUD’ s CDBG and USDA ’s Water and Waste Facility Loans and Grants to 
Alleviate Health Risks; Individual Water and Wastewater Grants; Direct 
Home Loans; and Home Repair Loans and Grants. 
 
 
 
33The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’ s Agency for Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry uses the following 16 American Community Survey variables to 
determine a community ’s vulnerability to hazardous events: below 150 percent of the 
poverty level, unemployed, housing cost burden, no high school diploma, no health 
insurance, age 65 and older, age 17 and younger, civilian with a disability, single- parent 
households, English language proficiency, racial or ethnic minority status, multiunit 
structures, mobile homes, crowding, no vehicle, and group quarters.  Five Federal

34 Since fiscal year 1991, U.S.-
Mexico border states have been required to set aside up to 10 percent of 
their CDBG funding for activities that address the water, sewage, and 
housing needs of colonias.35 This funding is referred to as the CDBG 
colonias set -aside. From fiscal years 2020 through 2023 (the period of 
our review), Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas set aside 10 percent, and 
California set aside 5 percent, of state CDBG funding for colonias. Each 
state develops priorities for funding colonias and criteria for selecting 
grantees. See table 2 for obligations to projects in colonias for fiscal years 
2020 through 2023.

In all four border states, we visited projects that officials said were funded 
by the CDBG colonias set-aside. For example, in Arizona we observed 
rehabilitated single-family homes, sidewalks, streetlights, and water and wastewater infrastructure projects. In California, we observed a cooling 
center to help colonia residents take shelter from extreme temperatures. In New Mexico, we observed drainage and infrastructure repairs in a colonia (see fig. 12). Texas allocated a portion of its set-aside to fund 
 
34The CDBG colonias set -aside is part of the funding provided to states to distribute to 
nonentitlement areas. Nonentitlement areas are generally smaller communities that do not 
qualify as entitlement communities. Entitlement communities generally are principal cities of metropolitan statistical areas, other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 
50,000, and qualified urban counties with populations of 200,000 or more (excluding the 
populations of entitlement cities).

Page 28  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Two USDA programs offer loans and grants to assist low -income rural 
areas whose residents are experiencing a significant health risk due to 
limited access to adequate water and wastewater systems. For these 
programs, USDA is required to give preference to applicants residing in 
colonias or to entities providing designated services to the residents of 
colonias.37  
• Water and Waste Facility Loans and Grants to Alleviate Health Risks. Through this program, USDA provides loans and grants for 
potable water and waste disposal facilities that serve communities 
whose residents face significant health risks due to a lack of adequate 
affordable water supply systems or waste disposal facilities.  
According to USDA officials, these projects generally fix issues found 
in a water system, such as contamination, or after a water or 
wastewater system fails.  This program is administered by the Water 
and Environmental Programs office of the Rural Utili ties Service, 
within USDA’s Rural Development Agency.  
• Individual Water and Wastewater Grants. Through this program, 
USDA provides grants to homeowners residing in communities facing significant health risks due to a lack of adequate affordable water 
supply systems or waste disposal facilities.
38 These grants are to 
connect water supply and waste disposal systems to individual residences or to install plumbing and related fixtures that facilitate the 
use of these systems. According to USDA, only residents of a colonia 
are eligible for these grants . While this program is funded through 
USDA’s Water and Environmental Programs, agency officials 
indicated it is administered by USDA’s Single Family Housing’s Home 
Repair Loans and Grants program. 
 
37In 2009, we recommended that USDA revise its process for determining eligibility to 
ensure that the agency only provides Section 306C Water and Waste Disposal Loans and 
Grants program funds for projects that benefit colonias, as defined in federal statute,  and 
to revise its priority process to better target limited funds to those projects meeting 
statutory preference criteria. In July 2012, USDA fully implemented this recommendation 
by modifying its regulations to allow for additional priority points to projects serving areas 
with colonias that lack access to water or waste disposal systems and face significant 
health problems. GAO, Rural Water Infrastructure: Improved Coordination and Funding Processes Could Enhance Federal Efforts to Meet Needs in the U.S. -Mexico Border

In all four border states, we visited projects that were funded by the Water and Environmental programs and serve colonias. For example, in 
Arizona, we visited a project that addressed contaminated water supplies 
and extended water services to colonias. In California, we visited a project that is installing a new water pipeline and pumps to meet the 
water needs of multiple communities. In New Mexico, we visited a water 
treatment facility  that removes arsenic contamination from a colonia’ s 
water supply (see fig. 13). In Texas, we visited a project to treat water and wastewater.

To support underserved communities, including colonias, USDA is 
required to set aside 5 percent of its annual lending authority for certain 
rural housing programs, and colonias are to receive priority for these

Service, within its Rural Development Agency.  
• Direct Home Loans. Through this program, USDA provides loans to 
eligible homeowners to acquire, build, repair or renovate, or relocate 
homes in eligible rural areas.40 
• Home Repair Loans and Grants. Through this program, USDA 
provides loans to eligible very low -income homeowners to repair or 
improve their homes. In addition, this program provides grants to 
homeowners age 62 or older to remove health and safety hazards or 
to make the home accessible to household members with 
disabilities.41 
USDA estimated that it obligated about $103 million to projects in 
colonias from fiscal years 2020 through 2023 (see table 4). USDA 
provided estimates —rather than exact values —for these obligations 
because it did not have reliable information from its loan and grant 
origination system.42 (See below for discussion of data reliability issues 
for these programs.) To estimate obligations to projects in colonias, 
 
39This set -aside for targeted underserved areas applies to the USDA programs under 
sections 502, 504, 514, 515, and 524 of the Housing Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 434, as 
amended, according to USDA ’s interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 1479(f)(4)(A). According to 
the statute, priority for set -aside funding will be given to any application for assistance that 
services the residents of a colonia and will be given in, or in close proximity to, these communiti es located in eligible states. 42 U.S.C. § 1479(f)(4)(B). According to USDA, the 
section 514, 515, and 524 programs did not award funding to colonias between fiscal 
years 2020 and 2023. The section 514 and 515 programs are administered by the Rural 
Housing Service’ s Multifamily Housing programs, and the section 524 program is 
administered by Single Family Housing programs. For more information on these 
programs see app. III.  
40USDA ’s Direct Home Loans program is also known as Single Family Direct Home 
Loans, the Section 502 Direct Loan Program, or Rural Home Loans. This program is 
authorized by section 502 of the Housing Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 434 (codified as amended 
at 42 U.S.C. § 1472), and is implemented by 7 C.F.R. pt. 3550.  
41USDA ’s Home Repair Loans and Grants is also known as Single Family Housing Repair 
Loans and Grants, or the Section 504 Home Repair program. This program is authorized 
by section 504 of the Housing Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 434 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1474) , and is implemented by 7 C.F.R. pt. 3550.  
42USDA uses the same systems to originate its loans and grants for the Direct Home Loan 
and Home Repair Loan and Grant programs. USDA ’s Dedicated Loan Origination and 
Servicing System, or origination system, expedites loan-making, standardizes information 
collection and recordkeeping, and facilitates communication between field offices and the 
Servicing and Asset Management Office. The system  tracks loans from application 
through servicing using two interconnected systems: UniFi and LoanServ.

We also visited colonias that received funding from USDA ’s Single Family 
Housing programs. For example, in Arizona, we observed a project where, according to officials, 10 lots will be redeveloped using USDA 
funds. We also viewed single-family homes that, according to officials, had received USDA assistance in Arizona and New Mexico (see fig. 14).

To be eligible for targeted funding to colonias through HUD ’s and USDA ’s 
programs, a community must meet the definition of a colonia, as shown in 
table 5. Definitions of colonias vary between programs, but generally 
include criteria relating to location, population size of the surrounding area, infrastructure conditions, and the date of recognition as a colonia. In 
addition, applicants must meet agency standards and program 
qualifications to receive funding.
43 
 
 
43For example, to qualify for USDA Single Family Housing loans, applicants must be 
unable to obtain a loan from other sources, meet certain income requirements, and use 
the loan only on eligible properties.

aEligible areas include the entire county where more than half of the area of the county is within 150 
miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, the definition of a colonia in 7 C.F.R. § 1777.4 does not 
specifically require the community be located in Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas. 
bThe statutes governing HUD’s CDBG colonias set-aside and USDA’s Single Family Housing require 
that a community be determined a colonia on the basis of objective criteria, which include but are not limited to the infrastructure conditions identified here. 
cColonias eligible for USDA Water and Environmental programs can also be designated as colonias 
by a federally recognized Tribe. 
dNov. 28, 1990 was the date of enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, 
Pub. L. No. 101-625, which is the date used in the statutory definitions of a colonia for the HUD CDBG program and USDA Single Family Housing programs. 42 U.S.C. § 5306 note, 42 U.S.C. § 1479(f)(8). USDA’s Water and Environmental programs use a different date as part of the definition of a colonia. 7 C.F.R. § 1777.4. 
 
Eligibility requirements differ across the targeted programs due to 
differences in statutory and regulatory definitions of a colonia; however, 
the definitions of a colonia do have some similarities. For example, HUD ’s 
CDBG colonias set-aside and USDA ’s Single Family Housing programs 
both require colonias to be located within a metropolitan statistical area 

[Extract from GAO_PDF_20241020_220257.pdf - Page 40]
 
     
Page 35  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  (MSA) with a population of 1 million or less.44 In contrast, there are no 
MSA -related population requirements in the colonia definition used by 
USDA ’s two Water and Environmental programs.45 
USDA did not have reliable information on actual obligations to colonias 
through its Single Family Housing programs, as noted above.46 To 
determine why this information was unreliable, we reviewed USDA ’s 
processes to identify, record, and track assistance provided to colonias 
and found areas for improvement. 
USDA does not have agency -wide or state-specific guidance that directs 
staff to identify if a Single Family Housing program loan or grant 
application is for a property in a colonia. As described above, for a 
community to meet the legal definition of a colo nia, several criteria must 
be met. One criterion is that the community must be identified as a 
“colonia” based on objective criteria, and according to USDA officials, the 
Single Family Housing program relies on state and local governments to 
make this determination. However, USDA does not have guidance for the 
Single Family Housing programs to help staff determine whether a 
community has been designated as a colonia by the state or local 
government. Rather, the agency relies on its state and field staff to use their local knowledge and professional judgment to try to discern if a 
community has been designated as a colonia by local officials , according 
to USDA officials. USDA has issued no guidance to field staff to facilitate 
this identification. In absence of guidance, USDA lacks assurance that 
applications from colonias are being consistently or correctly identified by 
staff.  
 
44To be eligible as a colonia for USDA ’s Single Family Housing set -aside for targeted 
underserved areas, the community cannot be in an MSA with a population exceeding 1 
million. However, if an applicant is not located in a colonia, as statutorily defined, and is, 
therefore, not eligible for the set-aside, the remaining funding for USDA Single Family 
Housing programs (i.e., the remaining 95 percent) may be available to these applicants. 
These applicants are required to meet all eligibility criteria for the program to which they 
applied, including the requirement that the project be located in a rural area as defined in 
42 U.S.C § 1490.  
45USDA ’s two Water and Environmental programs  are subject to agency regulations 
specifying that funding may go only to rural areas with a population of 10,000 or fewer 
people.   
46We determined that the obligation data from HUD for the CDBD colonias set -aside and 
from USDA for its Water and Environmental programs were reliable for the purpose of 
describing annual assistance provided to colonias for fiscal years 2020 –2023.  USDA ’s Single Family 
Housing Programs Do Not

Assistance to Colonias

[Extract from GAO_PDF_20241020_220257.pdf - Page 41]
 
     
Page 36  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Further, while USDA ’s system for processing loans and grants has a field 
for staff to record if an application is from a colonia, USDA officials told us 
that staff do not consistently use this feature. For this reason, USDA ’s 
loan and grant applications are not consistently identified or recorded as being from colonias. As a result, USDA is not collecting reliable data on 
the extent to which colonias have been assisted and may not be capable 
of ensuring that the agency is ful filling the set-aside and priori ty for 
colonias.  
USDA ’s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2022– 2026 states that the agency 
will implement  and administer programs in a way that increases access 
and program participation for underserved communities.
47 It also states 
that USDA will use data to understand who benefits from its programs 
and to ensure that its investments are directed to persistently poor, 
socially vulnerable, or high-need places. Furthermore, USDA is required 
to prioritize set-aside fundi ng for any application for assistance that 
services residents of colonias and will be used in, or in close proximity to, 
these communities located in eligible states.  
Although USDA has indicated that the level of funding received annually 
has been sufficient to fund all applications for colonias, therefore enabling 
USDA to meet its statutory obligations, there is no guarantee that funding 
will remain at such levels. By developing procedures that direct staff to 
identify and record whether Single Family Housing program applications 
are for properties located in colonias, USDA would have greater assurance that its programs are making investments in colonias in 
keeping with  the agency ’s goals to assist high-need places. Furthermore, 
such a process would help USDA ensure it is meeting its statutory 
directive to prioritize funding for projects in colonias as part of the set-
aside for targeted underserved areas. 
USDA has not been tracking the extent of its assistance to colonias 
through the Direct Home Loan and Home Repair Loans and Grants 
programs. For example, USDA officials initially provided us with data that showed a steep decline in obligations to colonias through these programs 
from fiscal years 2020 through 2023. When asked to provide a reason for 
the decline, USDA officials determined that the data, which were from their loan and grant origination system, were incorrect and likely

Page 37 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  undercounted obligations to colonias. They also told us that staff do not 
consistently record whether applications were for properties in colonias, as discussed above. Because USDA could not use its origination system 
to reliably account for loans and grants to colonias, the agency produced 
estimated obligations to colonias, which were four times higher compared with the data they initially provided.  
USDA ’s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2022– 2026 states that the agency 
will use data to understand who benefits from USDA programs and 
services.
48 However, USDA ’s lack of awareness of its data reliability 
issues for these programs indicates that the agency has not been using 
its data to track the extent of its assistance to colonias and manage the 
programs. Although USDA officials indicated that they met their statutory requirements related to colonias, the agency lacks a process for using 
data to ensure that it is meeting its objectives. Without such a process, 
USDA cannot understand the extent to which its programs are benefiting colonias.  
 
 
  
 
 
Colonias face several challenges in both accessing and subsequently 
using federal assistance.
49 These challenges relate to the characteristics 
of colonias, project costs and requirements, and local government

Page 38  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  capacity. Not all of these problems are unique to colonias, and many are 
consistent with problems faced by rural communities more generally.  
Rural or remote areas. Colonias are often located in rural areas that are 
far away from existing infrastructure, particularly water and wastewater infrastructure. As a result, it may not be cost effective to connect them to 
existing infrastructure. Studies have shown that for m any colonias, private 
wells and on -site wastewater treatment are necessary.
50 Advocacy 
groups and some local officials also told us that because of the 
remoteness, contractors may not be willing or able to work in these areas, which can increase costs. 
For example, during a site visit near El Paso, Texas, we visited a colonia 
located approximately 10 miles from existing water and wastewater 
infrastructure. Local officials told us that connecting the community to 
existing services was unlikely ever to be cost -effective. We also visited a 
New Mexico colonia that relied solely on wells for its water because it was 
separated from existing water infrastructure by a mountain range. 
Language barrier and lack of trust in government. In most areas with 
colonias, residents are overwhelmingly of Hispanic origin, and many 
speak Spanish as their primary language. L ocal officials in all four states 
told us that residents may face difficulties in communicating their needs to 
government officials. They also may be concerned about potential negative effects from interacting with the government, such as adverse actions against undocumented family members. 
Competing needs. A 2015 report by the Rural Community Assistance 
Partnership found that many communities had multiple competing 
infrastructure needs, including for housing and adequate water and 
wastewater services.
51 In addition, according to advocacy organizations, 
colonias often lack the resources or expertise to apply for funding 
themselves, so county governments typically take the lead. According to 
local officials, the county often must prioritize which among its  colonias it 
will help apply for funding and administer projects. 
 
50For example, see Rural Community Assistance Partnership, U.S. -Mexico Border Needs 
Assessment  (2015), and U.S. Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection 
Agency, U.S. Mexico Border Needs Assessment  (2014).

Page 39  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Infrastructure costs. Infrastructure projects, especially water - and 
wastewater -related projects, tend to be expensive, particularly in relation 
to available federal funding. During our site visits, officials in all four states 
told us that increasing costs have made it challe nging to complete 
infrastructure projects for colonias. For example, in New Mexico, the 
estimated cost of one flood-control project had increased from $12.7 
million when originally designed in 2019 to $42 million in 2023, according 
to local officials. In addition, members of water boards and local 
government officials told us that infrastructure projects take years to plan. 
As a result, initial budgets may be outdated by the time work begins. 
Officials said this may result in the need to seek additional funding. For example, a water board we visited in Arizona was in the process of obtaining additional USDA funding to cover a project’ s rising prices.  
Build America, Buy America Act requirement. Provisions of the Build 
America, Buy America Act have increased costs or led to delays, 
according to local officials we spoke with in all four border states.
52 The 
act states that all federal financial assistance can only be obligated for a 
project if all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials 
used in the project are produced in the United States.53 Items meeting 
these requirements, such as domestically produced manhole covers, 
often cost significantly more or require significant lead time, the officials said.  
Staff capacity. Grant programs can be complex, and local government 
officials in all four border states told us they do not have the capacity to 
apply for or administer all funding that may be available to assist colonias. 
For example, officials at one county government said they did not have 
sufficient staff to apply for available USDA funding because so many staff 
resources were devoted to CDBG compliance. Officials at another locality 
 
52The Build America, Buy America Act was enacted under Division G, Title IX of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, 135 Stat. 429, 1294-1309 
(2021).  
53Pub. L. No. 117-58, § 70914(a), 135 Stat. 429, 1298 (2021). The act defines these 
requirements as a Domestic Content Procurement Preference. Pub. L. No. 117-58, § 
70912(2), 135 Stat. 429, 1296 (2021). Waivers of the domestic content procurement 
preference may be available.  Pub. L. No. 117-58, § 70914(b), 135 Stat. 429, 1298 (2021). 
Furthermore, section 70911(15) of the act states that domestic content procurement preference policies apply to all federal government procurements and to various federal -
aid infrastructure programs as of the date of enactment. Additionally, federal agencies 
have a responsibility under the act to identify all domestic content procurement 
preferences applicable to federal financial assistance. Pub. L. No. 117-58, §§ 70911(15), 
70912(2), 70913(b), 135 Stat. 429, 1295- 1296, 1298 (2021).    Project Costs and

Page 40  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  similarly cited lacking sufficient staff to apply for additional federal projects 
and comply with complex agency requirements. 
Predevelopment costs. Local government officials in all four states 
noted that certain predevelopment costs may not be eligible for grant 
funding. For example, officials in one state told us that while CDBG 
projects require environmental planning, CDBG funds cannot be used to 
pay for such studies.54 As a result, local governments may need to 
finance these costs themselves or pursue additional grants.  
Federal agencies have taken steps to mitigate certain challenges that 
colonias face in accessing and using federal assistance. For example: 
• Coordination to leverage funds. To help address challenges related 
to project costs, some federal agencies have coordinated on projects 
to leverage one another ’s funds. For example, USDA has partnered 
with the Environmental Protection Agency to jointly provide funding for 
wastewater projects through the Closing America’ s Wastewater 
Access Gap Program. Further, USDA sometimes provides additional grant and loan funds to assist with cost overruns in projects it 
originally funded, according to USDA and local officials.
55 
• Technical assistance or additional grants. To help address issues 
related to lack of capacity or resources for predevelopment, federal agencies have also provided technical assistance or grants. For 
example, recipients of USDA funding in all four states said USDA staff 
offer assistance in filling out applications for federal funding. These 
recipients also noted they had effective working relationships with 
HUD, USDA, and  other federal agencies. They also cited the agency 
staffs ’ willingness to answer questi ons or provide technical 
assistance. Further, USDA provides technical assistance by funding a 
Technical Assistance and Training program. This program helps 
communities identify and plan for community needs and subsequently 
prepare applications for financial assistance. Recipients also 
 
54According to HUD officials, environmental planning costs are not disallowed from CDBG 
funding. However, many states do not allow these costs to be funded using CDBG funds 
because the environmental planning process may reveal that a project cannot move 
forward.  
55During a site visit in New Mexico, we learned that there had been some delays in 
USDA ’s processing of applications that would allow colonias that had USDA Water and 
Environmental Program loans to obtain additional assistance from other parties. However, 
the agency subsequently took actions to address this issue, such as ensuring local 
officials had necessary authority to approve these applications and establishing a new 
formal tracking system for such requests.  Federal Agencies Have 
Taken Steps to Mitigate 
Some of These 
Challenges  

[Extract from GAO_PDF_20241020_220257.pdf - Page 46]
 
     
Page 41  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  discussed obtaining grant funding from one agency, such as the 
Economic Development Administration, to prepare studies required by 
another agency, such as HUD.  
• Networks to provide local assistance. To improve infrastructure 
and community development in rural areas, the federal government 
established the Rural Partners Network in 2022. This network consists 
of federal staff placed in more than 25 rural communities, including 
several located in areas with colonias. These staff are to work with 
local officials to help them navigate and access federal resources 
across multiple agencies. For example, in southern New Mexico, the 
Rural Partner s Network identified local needs, such as for improved 
flood control and water and wastewater services, that affect colonias. The Rural Partners Network has also hosted events in other states 
where it brought stakeholders together to discuss federal funding 
opportunities. 
• Collaboration with states. USDA and HUD have ongoing 
collaboration activities to help identify key needs and facilitate access 
to federal assistance for states and stakeholders. For example, HUD 
provides feedback to states on their consolidated plans, which are created every 3 to 5 years, and their annual action plans. These plans 
are used to identify state priorities for CDBG funds. HUD also meets annually with the border states to learn about the key needs of their 
colonias, according to HUD officials. HUD has ongoing monitoring 
activities to determine whether CDBG funds are being used to help 
address these needs. USDA collaborates with the states through 
initiatives like the Rural Partners Network and Closing America’ s 
Wastewater Access Gap, a joint program with the Environmental Protection Agency, to identify states ’ challenges and coordinate 
federal assistance to address them.
56 
 
56The Closing America’ s Wastewater Access Gap program provides no-cost technical 
assistance to communities with failing septic systems or without existing wastewater 
infrastructure. As part of this effort, the program conducts a community wastewater 
assessment, which brings tog ether state, tribal, and local collaborators and technical 
experts to assess the current status of wastewater infrastructure in participating 
communities.

Page 42  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Population growth in the Southwest has led to a situation where certain 
communities have or will become ineligible for the CDBG colonias set-
aside under the current CDBG definition of a colonia.57 As previously 
noted, to meet the definition of a colonia and be eligible for the program, a community must be located within an MSA of 1 million people or less.
58 
Population growth has resulted in some MSAs with colonias exceeding 
this population threshold. 
For example, colonias in Pinal County, Arizona, immediately south of 
Phoenix, were eligible for the CDBG colonias set -aside in 1990, 
according to local officials. However, local officials stated that in 2000 the 
county was included in the Phoenix MSA, whose population exceeds 1 
million. As a result, Pinal County became ineligible for the CDBG colonias 
set-aside despite having several communities  that otherwise met the 
statutory definition of a colonia and were designated as such by the local 
government, acc ording to local officials . During our site visit, we observed 
that these communities were in rural areas and shared similar needs and 
characteristics of communities we visited that still met the CDBG 
definition of colonia.  
Some communities in the Tucson, Arizona, MSA will also soon lose 
eligibility for CDBG colonias set-aside funding. That MSA exceeded 1 
million people in the 2020 Census, and HUD officials stated they are 
currently in the process of decertifying it for futur e awards.59 According to 
 
57USDA ’s Single Family Housing programs, which contain a set -aside and colonia priority 
for such funding, includes a similar MSA requirement in its colonia definition. Accordingly, 
certain communities will become ineligible for the colonia priority over the next several 
years given the Southwest ’s population growth. According to USDA, however, this 
program has been historically undersubscribed, and loans in areas with colonias are 
frequently funded without the need for set -aside funds or use of the colonia s priority. 
Therefore, colonias are not at risk of losing Single Family Housing Program funds at this 
time. If demand were to increase for this program, the MSA requirement could present limitations, as we discuss herein.  
58As relevant here, one criterion required to meet the CDBG statutory definition of 
“colonia” is that the community be in the “United States -Mexico border region. ” The statute 
defines the United States -Mexico border region as “the area of the United States within 
150 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico, except that the term does 
not include any standard metropolitan statistical area that has a population  exceeding 
1,000,000. ” 42 U.S.C. § 5306 note.  
59HUD relies on the states to certify communities as colonias. HUD  is currently developing 
a process to review the populations of MSAs after each census to determine if the 
population of an MSA exceeds 1 million. If it does exceed this threshold, HUD will send  a 
letter to the state stating that CDBG awards to colonias in that MSA will no longer count 
toward the CDBG colonias set -aside.   Many Communities Will 
Soon Become Ineligible 
for the CDBG Colonias 
Set-Aside under the 
Current Statutory 
Definition of a Colonia

Page 43  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  HUD officials, the agency explored legal interpretations that would allow 
the eight communities otherwise meeting the colonia definition to remain 
eligible. However, HUD officials concluded that the Cranston-Gonzalez 
National Affordable Housing Act, which established the colonia definition 
for the CDBG set-aside, does not allow these communities to remain 
eligible.  
HUD officials expect that the El Paso and McAllen MSAs, both in Texas, will exceed 1 million in the future. These two MSAs contain some of the 
highest numbers of colonias. We estimate that a total of 1,222  colonias 
will become ineligible over the next few years in these two MSAs. This 
represents nearly 60 percent of all the colonias that HUD has identified.
60 
Figure 15 illustrates the border region areas that have lost or will likely 
lose eligibility for CDBG set-aside funding in the near future. Importantly, 
these communities will still be eligible to apply for CDBG funds, but will no 
longer be eligible for the targeted set -aside.  
 
60This analysis is based exclusively on the inability of communities to meet the 
requirement of being in an MSA of 1 million or less. Existing colonias could be decertified 
for other reasons, such as no longer meeting additional definitional criteria for a colonia.

Page 45 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  We have previously reported limitations of using MSAs to define rural or 
urban areas.61 Specifically, we reported that MSAs were not intended to 
provide the basis for urban and rural classifications, and that MSAs can 
contain both urban and rural areas. We noted that MSA eligibility requirements had resulted in dissimilar determinations for what appeared 
to be similar areas. This finding is consistent with our observations that 
locally designated colonias in Pinal County, Arizona, were similar to those we observed in other areas that remain eligible as colonias for other 
targeted assistance. Specifically, the Pinal County colonias we observed 
are located in a rural area surrounded by farmland, and they appeared to have significant needs, such as poor -quality housing, deferred 
maintenance, and drainage issues (see fig. 16).

61GAO, Rural Housing: Changing the Definition of Rural Could Improve Eligibility 
Determinations,  GAO-05-110 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 3, 2004). In this report, we 
recommended that Congress consider eliminating the MSA criterion for Rural Housing 
Service housing programs and that Congress recommend that the Rural Housing Service 
use density -based measures as a basis for its eligibility decisions. This matter for 
congressional consideration was implemented.  


[Extract from GAO_PDF_20241020_220257.pdf - Page 51]
 
     
Page 46  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  We also previously noted that there are alternatives to using MSAs to 
identify rural and urban areas.62 These include alternative measures such 
as the Census Bureau’ s urbanized areas and urban clusters definitions. 
These are density -based measures that provide finer -scale information. 
These measures do not necessarily follow political boundaries and they 
define an area as rural by exclusion —that is, the measures view all areas 
not already identified as urbanized areas or urban clusters as “rural. ” At 
the time of that 2004 report, we observed that this definition greatly increased the number of people who were defined as residing in a rural 
area compared with using a determination based on an MSA. 
HUD officials expressed additional concerns about the CDBG statutory 
definition of a colonia. For example, HUD officials stated the definition 
was limited because it excludes communities that did not exist prior to 
1990 but have other relevant characteristics, such as water, sewer, and 
housing challenges. HUD officials also noted the definition excludes communities located outside of the border region. This view was shared 
by one advocacy organization, whose representatives noted that there 
are many areas of the country facing housing conditions similar to those 
of colonias. We did not evaluate the effect of statutory provisions other than those related to the MSA in which a colonia is located.  
When the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act was 
enacted in 1990, the statute made many colonias with significant needs 
eligible for targeted assistance through CDBG set-aside funding. 
However, the MSA requirement, necessary to meet the CDBG definition 
of colonia, has not been updated since the set-aside ’s enactment in 1990, 
and the population in the Southwest has changed significantly since that 
time.
63 Colonia communities that lose targeted funding will remain eligible 
for CDBG entitlement funds (funds that are not part of the colonias set-
aside), but they will no longer have access to funds that were designated 
to address their specific needs.64 
 
62GAO -05-110.  
63As described above, the MSA requirement is contained in the definition of “United 
States -Mexico Border Region”  in 42 U.S.C. § 5306 note. Thus, changes to the MSA 
requirement could be addressed through a change to the definition of “colonia, ” the 
definition of “United States -Mexico Border Region, ” or through other methods.  
64The CDBG program provides funding directly to metropolitan cities and urban counties, 
known as entitlement communities, and to states for distribution to nonentitlement 
communities. However, these funds are to be used to address needs throughout the 
munici pality and are not specifically targeted to colonias.  

[Extract from GAO_PDF_20241020_220257.pdf - Page 52]
 
     
Page 47 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Given the limitations in using MSAs as a measure of rurality and the 
increases in population in the Southwest since 1990, the MSA criterion that is part of the CDBG definition of a colonia may no longer be an 
appropriate measure of the needs of these communities. Without updated 
legislation, colonias that currently have needs and circumstances similar 
to what they had in 1990 may not have access to targeted CDBG assistance, which may be inconsistent with Congress ’s original intent.  
Congress enacted legislation in the early 1990s to address conditions in 
colonias by providing targeted funding, including CDBG funds. But with 
shifts in population since that time, many colonias soon will no longer meet the CDBG statutory definition of a colonia, which requires a 
community to be located in an MSA with a population of 1 million or less. 
Revising this MSA requirement by, for example, adopting some other measure of rurality could help preserve the eligibility of many communities that were originally intended to be served by the set-aside. 
In addition, USDA has been legislatively tasked with helping colonias, 
including through targeted funding in its Single Family Housing programs, 
and the agency has set corresponding goals. However, due to the agency ’s inability to consistently identify which applications are for colonia 
projects, it does not have reliable information on the program ’s effect on 
these communities. By implementing procedures to identify and record applications related to properties in colonias, USDA will be better able to 
ensure its investments align with agency goals and statutory 
requirements. Further, using data to track program usage in colonias would enhance the agency ’s understanding of how effectively these 
programs serve colonias and inform management to aid decision-making in support of these communities. 
Given population growth in the Southwest, Congress should consider 
revising the statutory requirement that, in order to be a colonia eligible for the CDBG set-aside, an identifiable community be located within an MSA with a population of 1 million or less. (Matter for Consideration 1)  
 We are making the following two recommendations to USDA:  
The Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that the Rural Housing 
Service Administrator develops and implements procedures for identifying 
and recording whether applications for Single Family Housing programs are for properties in colonias. (Recommendation 1) Conclusions

Page 49 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  This report (1) describes conditions in colonias, (2) examines federal 
assistance available to colonias, and (3) examines challenges that may affect colonias in obtaining and using federal assistance and federal efforts to mitigate those challenges.  
To address all objectives, we visited 24 colonias in Arizona, California, 
New Mexico, and Texas to observe conditions and projects funded by 
federal programs. We identified these colonias by reviewing lists of projects funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) during fiscal years 
2020– 2023 to identify local governments and other entities that had 
recently obtained funding for colonias. We then judgmentally selected 24 
colonias that (1) reflected a mix of incorporated and unincorporated 
areas, (2) reflected a mix of types and amounts of federal funding, (3) had been identified in our interviews with state officials and other stakeholders, and (4) had received recent federal funding.  
During site visits, we conducted interviews with local government officials, 
grant recipients, local advocacy organizations (if available), and USDA 
field staff to discuss conditions in colonias, federal assistance to these communities, and challenges to receiving federal assistance. We also 
made physical observations of completed and ongoing federal projects, 
and we observed conditions in the wider community. Information we obtained from these site visits is not generalizable to all colonias. In 
addition to site visits, we also interviewed the following to learn about 
conditions in colonias, federal assistance to these communities, and challenges to receiving federal assistance:  
• federal agencies, including HUD, USDA, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency;  
• state offices, including the Arizona Department of Housing, California Department of Housing and Community Development, New Mexico 
Department of Finance and Administration, and the Texas 
Department of Agriculture; 
• local government officials, including officials from Arizona in Pinal County, Nogales, Yuma, and Bisbee; from California in Imperial County; from New Mexico in the Southwest New Mexico Council of 
Governments and Grant and Luna Counties; and from Texas in 
Cameron, Hidalgo, and El Paso Counties; and  
• representatives from national and local nonprofit organizations such as the Council of State Community Development Agencies, the Housing Assistance Council, and the Rural Community Assistance Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and

colonias.  
For our first objective, we performed a geographic analysis of local and 
national -level data sets. Specifically, to identify the geographic location of 
colonias, we analyzed HUD geospatial data as of 2010, which were the 
most recent available data.1 Similar geospatial data were not available for 
colonias eligible for assistance through USDA programs. The dataset 
from HUD included XY coordinates of these colonias but did not include 
the specific boundaries of these communities . We verified these data 
through interviews with HUD officials and corroboration of locations with 
data from the University of New Mexico. Due to these limitations, we used 
these data to identify the census tracts in which colonias were located, 
and we used these census tracts as our geographic unit of analysis (i.e., 
areas with colonias) (see fig. 17).  
 
 
 
1HUD officials told us they collected these data from the relevant state agencies in 
Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas in 2009 and 2010. Officials said this dataset 
would not reflect any communities that were designated as colonias in these states after 2010.

aAreas with colonias are census tracts that contain one or more colonias included in Department of 
Housing and Urban Development or University of New Mexico data as of 2010. 
bOther border regions are census tracts within 150 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border in each state that 
do not contain one or more colonias, as identified in Department of Housing and Urban Development 
or University of New Mexico data as of 2010. 
cThis figure reflects the location of colonias included in Department of Housing and Urban 
Development or University of New Mexico data as of 2010. 
 
To describe economic and housing conditions in areas with colonias, we 
analyzed data from the Census Bureau’ s American Community Survey 
2017– 2021 5-year estimates. We also analyzed these data for the other 
border regions in each state and the state overall to provide context for 
our analysis.2 
Because the American Community Survey is an ongoing survey based on 
a probability sample, we accounted for sampling error associated with 
these survey estimates by using the standard errors provided with these estimates. When deriving new estimates based on American Community 
Survey estimates —such as by combining census -tract-level estimates or 
obtaining percentages or ratios of estimates —we obtained the standard 
 
2Other border regions included census tracts in each state that were within 150 miles of 
the U.S. -Mexico border, were not located within a metropolitan statistical area whose 
population exceeded 1 million, and did not contain any colonias.

variance replicate tables  when they were available, and otherwise we 
used American Community Survey approximation methodology. To 
determine whether estimates differed, we conducted statistical tests at 
the 95 percent confidence level based on each estimate’ s standard error. 
To analyze exposure to natural hazards in areas with colonias, we 
selected four of the seven natural hazards identified in a prior GAO report 
as being likely to be exacerbated by climate change in the United States.3 
The four hazards are heat, wildfires, flooding, and storm surges from 
hurricanes.4 
For our selected hazards, we used national -level data from federal 
agencies that we determined to be the most appropriate.5 Data sources 
for each of the hazards we analyzed are as follows: 
• Heat. To analyze exposure to heat, we used data from the fourth 
National Climate Assessment on the projected annual exposure to 
maximum temperatures in the midcentury (i.e., 2036– 2065).6 
 
3GAO, Nuclear Power Plants: NRC Should Take Actions to Fully Consider the Potential 
Effects of Climate Change, GAO -24-106326  (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 2, 2023). To identify 
and select national -level datasets in this report, we used information from the fourth 
National Climate Assessment. The fifth National Climate Assessment was released on 
Nov. 14, 2023, after we had obtained and analyzed the hazard datasets. We reviewed 
relevant sections from the fifth National Climate Assessment and did not identify major 
differences in the predicted or projected trends for the selected natural hazards. U.S. 
Global Change Research Program, Fifth National Climate Assessment  (Washington, D.C.: 
2023), and Fourth National Climate Assessment  (Washington, D.C.: 2018 ). 
4The three natural hazards we excluded from our analysis were cold, sea level rise, and 
drought. We did not analyze data on (1) cold because the National Climate Assessment stated that the areas with colonias either already had or will see a reduction in ex treme 
cold events, so we chose to focus our analysis on heat; (2) sea level rise because a 
relatively small percentage of the areas with colonias are coastal; and (3) drought 
because we were unable to identify national -level geospatial data that were both relevant 
to areas with colonias and sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  
5To identify the best available federal -level hazard data, we relied on a prior GAO report.  
6Specifically, we analyzed the projected change in the annual number of days with a 
maximum temperature greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit. These projections are based on both low - and high-emission scenarios that incorporate different assumptions about 
future reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Page 53  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  • Wildfire. To analyze exposure to wildfire hazard, we used 2023 
Wildfire Hazard Potential data from the U.S. Forest Service.7 For 
reporting purposes, we grouped wildfire hazard potential into two 
categories: medium and high/very high.8 
• Flooding. To analyze exposure to flood hazard, we used 2023 data 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ’s National Flood 
Hazard Layer. For reporting purposes, a census tract is at high risk if it intersects with a 100-year flood plain and medium risk if it intersects 
with a 500-year flood plain. We did not assess flood risk in some 
tracts because we found that they did not intersect with any flood hazard data, which meant we could not assess their flood risk. These 
tracts included five in New Mexico ( because 90 percent of these tracts 
did not have flood plain data) and all tracts in Texas (because over 50 
percent of tracts in Texas did not intersect with any flood hazard 
areas). 
• Hurricane storm surge. To analyze exposure to hurricane storm 
surge, we used 2022 data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’ s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from 
Hurricanes model. For reporting purposes, we grouped hurricane risk 
into two categories: at risk and not at risk.  
We assessed the reliability of the fourth National Climate Assessment 
climate projections data we used to analyze heat exposure by (1) 
interviewing National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration 
officials knowledgeable about the data and (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the system that produced them. We 
determined the data to be reliable for our purposes. 
To assess the reliability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ’s 
National Flood Hazard Layer, the National Oceanographic and 
Atmospheric Administration’ s data on Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges 
from Hurricanes, and the U.S. Forest Service’ s Wildfire Hazard Potential 
data, we reviewed a prior GAO data reliability assessment for a report 
using the same data.
9 We determined the data to be reliable for the 
purpose of describing the risk of heat, wildfire, flooding, and hurricane 
 
7The primary intended use of the data on wildfire potential is to identify priority areas 
where wildfire may be difficult to contain. The data do not explicitly show wildfire threat or 
risk. 
8“High” and “very high” wildfire hazard potentials correspond to areas at the 85 percentile 
or greater of wildfire hazard potential.

correspondence with officials from the National Oceanographic and 
Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, and the U.S. Forest Service, we ensured that these data 
remained appropriate and reliable, considering any subsequent updates 
or changes made to the data. 
To describe the conditions of water and wastewater infrastructure in 
colonias, we reviewed academic literature and government reports. To 
identify existing literature and reports, we conducted searches of various 
databases, such as ProQuest, EBSCO, Scopus, and Dialog, for studies 
describing access to water and wastewater infrastructure in colonias 
published in the previous 10 years. A GAO methodologist reviewed 
methodologies of selected studies to assess the overall quality of the 
studies ’ findings. 
For our second objective, we reviewed relevant literature, laws and regulations, and agency materials to identify federal programs that 
provided assistance to communities with colonias. We reviewed materials 
from 14 agencies, including EPA, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of the Treasury. We then established and applied 
criteria to determine which programs provided targeted assistance to 
colonias. Our criteria required that programs had to set aside a portion of funding for projects i n colonias or prioritize funding to projects in 
colonias.
10 The programs had to be active in all four border states 
between fiscal years 2020 and 2023. For each targeted program, we then 
analyzed legislation, agency regulations, and agency documentation on 
how funds can be used and program eligibility requirements . In appendix 
III, we describe federal programs with special features that may benefit 
colonias ; these programs met some but not all of our criteria for  targeted 
funding.  
From HUD and USDA, we obtained data on annual obligations to 
colonias from fiscal years 2020 through 2023 for each of the five targeted programs we identified. We assessed the reliability of the data by 
reviewing relevant documentation, interviewing knowledgeable agency 
officials, and performing manual data testing. We determined the data from HUD ’s Community Development Block Grant program and USDA ’s 
 
10Funding may be prioritized to colonias by requiring the agency to review and process 
applications for projects to colonias before other applications or by adding additional 
points for application scoring to projects from colonias.

Page 55  GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  Water and Environmental programs were sufficiently reliable for the 
purpose of describing obligations for targeted programs. 
In response to our follow -up questions, USDA officials determined that 
the initial Single Family Housing program obligation data they provided to 
us from their origination system were unreliable, as discussed in this 
report. Subsequently, USDA estimated obligations to colonias by 
comparing digital maps of areas with colonias to the addresses of loan and grant recipients. We determined the estimated Single Family Housing 
program data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of describing 
obligations to col onias. In addition, due to data reliability concerns, we 
assessed USDA Single Family Housing processes to identify and track 
data against statutory and agency requirements, such as USDA ’s 
Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022– 2026.
11 
In addition, we also obtained data from HUD, USDA, and EPA on 
Congressionally Directed Funding and Community Project Funding to 
colonias (described in app. III).12 HUD provided data on Congressionally 
Directed Funding/Community Project Funding to counties with colonias, 
and USDA and EPA provided data on funding specifically to colonias. We 
determined the Congressionally Directed Funding and Community Project 
Funding data from HUD, EPA, and USDA were sufficiently reliable for the 
purpose of describing this funding.  
For our third objective, we reviewed relevant literature and interviewed the parties described above. To determine the potential effect of 
population changes on communities ’ eligibility for targeted programs, we 
reviewed the s tatutory eligibility requirements for colonias for HUD and 
USDA programs, analyzed geographic data from HUD on the 
communities that, according to HUD, are currently eligible as colonias 
under its definition, and reviewed relevant legislation. We discussed 
federal efforts to mitigate challenges to obtaining funding during the 
interviews described above.

Appendix III: Other Federal Programs That May Assist Colonias  
    
Page 66 GAO -24-106732  Colonias Communities  This appendix describes federal assistance to colonias through 
Congressionally Directed Spending or Community Project Funding, as well as through programs with special features that benefit colonias and programs reported to be useful for colonias.  
In fiscal years 2022 and 2023, according to agency data, Congressionally 
Directed Spending or Community Project Funding provided $91 million for 
grants to areas with colonias.
1 These grants were administered by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Grants ranged from about $100,000 to $4 million for projects that included water 
and wastewater improvements, home improvements, and community 
development. 
Table 6 lists federal programs with special features for colonias or certain 
communities that include colonias.
2 These features may include 
prioritizing colonia projects in competitive applications or reserving a 
portion of funding for technical assistance to colonias. All the identified 
programs with these characteristics are USDA programs. According to USDA officials, between fiscal years 2020 through 2023, the Circuit Rider 
Program provided technical assistance to colonias. The Regional Food 
Business Centers program was launched in 2022. The Broadband Technical Assistance and ReConnect Loan and Grant Program 
introduced special features for colonias in fiscal year 2023. The Farm 
Labor Housing Program (Section 514 ), Rural Housing Site Loans (Section 
524), and Rural Rental Housing New Construction Program (Section 515)  
did not award funding to colonias during this period, according to USDA information. 
 
1As part of the fiscal year 2022 and 2023 appropriations processes, Members of Congress 
could request provisions designating an amount of funds to a particular recipient —such as 
a local government or nonprofit organization —for a specific project. These provisions are 
called “Congressionally Directed Spending” in the U.S. Senate and “Community Project 
Funding” in the House of Representatives. GAO,  Tracking The Funds: Agencies Have 
Begun Executing FY 2022 Community Project Funding/Congressionally Directed 
Spending,  GAO-23-106318 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 28, 2023).  
2Table 6 does not include five programs that provided targeted assistance to colonias that 
were the focus of this report: the Department of Housing and Urban Development ’s 
Community Development Block Grant program and USDA ’s Water and Waste Facility 
Loans and Grants to Alleviate Health Risks; Individual Water and Wastewater Grants; Direct Home Loans; and Home Repair Loans and Grants.  Appendix III: Other Federal Programs That

ReConnect Loan and Grant Program  Provides loans and grants for the 
construction, improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide broadband service in eligible rural areas.  A 100 percent grant with no match 
requirement is available to projects benefiting certain communities, including colonias.  
Regional Food Business Centers  Supports food producers by providing 
localized assistance to access a variety of markets, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.  Colonias were identified by USDA as a 
high-priority area for service as part of Regional Food Center selection.  
Rural Housing Site Loans (Section 524)  Loans to nonprofit organizations to acquire 
and develop sites for low - or moderate-
income families.  There is a 5 percent set -aside and funding

Table 7 lists federal programs that do not target colonias through funding 
or special features but were identified in interviews with state or local 
government officials and nonprofit representatives as being useful to 
colonias.3 
 
3The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program, authorized by the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No. 117- 2, 135 Stat. 4, 223-228, was also 
noted as helpful to colonias by local government representatives from Texas and Arizona. 
We did not include it on our list because it was a one-time funding program. In addition, 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides information on programs for 
residents of colonias on its website at  https://www.hud.gov/groups/hudprograms .  Federal Programs
