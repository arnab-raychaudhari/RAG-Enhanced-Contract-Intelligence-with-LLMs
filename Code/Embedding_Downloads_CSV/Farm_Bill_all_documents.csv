SUMMARY  
 
The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with  
Current Law  
Congress sets food and agriculture policy through periodic legislation referred to as fa rm bills. 
The previous farm bill, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ( P.L. 115 -334), was extended 
by one year ( P.L. 118 -22)—until September 30, 2024, and for the 2024 crop year. The farm bill 
covers  numerous  policies and programs , including commodity support, conservation, trade and 
food aid, domestic food assistance, credit, rural develo pment, research, forestry, energy, 
horticulture, and crop insurance , among others . 
The Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024  (H.R. 8467 ) was introduced on May 21, 2024 . On May 23, 2024, the 
House Committee on Agriculture ordered  the bill  reported favorably to the House by a vote of 33 -21. On August 2, 2024, the 
Congressional Budget Office published a score of  H.R. 8467 . The score  indicat es the bill would increase direct (mandatory) 
spending  that is  subject to budget enforcement by $15.4 billion over five years (FY2025 -FY2029) and by $33 .0 billion over 
nine years  (FY2025 -FY2033). This  would  include a ne t increase of about $ 43.4 billion  over nine years  for commodity 
support programs ; a net decrease of $1.8 billion for conservation programs ; a net decrease of $20.6 billion  for the domestic 
nutrition programs  by limiting future increases to the Thrifty Food  Plan (TFP) that is used to determine Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  benefit levels ; and an increase of $12.0 billion for other titles .  
H.R. 8467  would reauthorize most existing programs through FY2029, with modifications to specific programs and funding 
levels. H.R. 8467  would amend and extend commodity support programs unde r Title I and increase the revenue guarantees",

and reference prices for commodities covered under the Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs, 
respectively. The bill would provide a one -time opportunity to grant eligible producers new ba se acre holdings. The bill 
would restrict the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s (USDA ’s) discretionary use of the Commodity Credit Corporation over 
the next decade. Within the conservation title (Title II), nearly all programs would receive increased mandat ory funding. The 
bill would reauthorize the Conservation Reserve Program at its current level of 27 million acres. H.R. 8467  would emphasize 
the use of precision agriculture technol ogy within the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and Conservation 
Stewardship Program working lands programs. Title III would reauthorize all international food aid programs and seek to 
expand opportunities for U.S. grown commodities, including frui ts and vegetables, in international markets.  
H.R. 8467 , Title IV,  would amend domestic nutrition policy through changes to the SNAP eligibility and benefit calculations 
and adjustme nts to state administration of the program. The bill would reauthorize and increase funding for several food 
distribution and assistance programs, including The Emergency Food Assistance Program. H.R. 8467  would amend the 
process for updating the TFP, adding constraints that would prevent USDA from reevaluating the market basket in a way that 
would exceed inflation.  
The bill would increase loan limits authorized under the credit tit le (Title V) for individual borrowers for USDA farm loan 
programs and allow the Farm Credit System to make loans for essential community services. The bill would support rural 
communities under Title VI by reauthorizing rural development programs to addres s rural health care focused on substance 
use disorder prevention and treatment, broadband deployment with new minimum buildout speed requirements, business 
development, and rural child care, among other  issues . Title VII would increase appropriations for e xtension and research 
activities; designate new high -priority research areas, including fertilizer and nutrient management; and establish a 
commission to modernize the National Agricultural Statistics Service.",

The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with Current Law  
 
Congressional Research Service   1 Introduction  
Congress has established federal policy related to the food and agriculture sectors through 
periodic farm bills since the 1930s. The farm bill,  an omnibus, multiyear law, is the primary piece 
of legislation that governs an array of agricultural and food market programs. As technology, 
economic conditions, and the agriculture system have evolved, Congress has regularly revisited 
agricultural polic y through farm legislation. Policy areas addressed in farm bills have expanded 
from providing support for selected commodities to including an array of programs and policies, 
such as commodity support, conservation, trade, domestic nutrition assistance, cr edit, rural 
development, research, forestry, energy, horticulture, and crop insurance. Congress has passed 18 
farm bills.1  
Certain programs included in the farm bill are permanently authorized and would continue in the 
absence of new farm legislation. Ot hers, such as support programs for commodities including 
dairy, wheat, rice, cotton, and corn, would expire and return to so -called “permanent laws” dating 
back to the 1930s and 1940s. Under permanent law, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
would be  required to support eligible commodities at levels that exceed 2024 market prices, 
incurring billions of dollars in additional government expenditures and higher prices for 
consumers, while ending support for some commodities including soybeans, peanuts, and sugar.2 
Congress passed a one -year extension ( P.L. 118 -22, Division B, §102) to the Agriculture 
Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill;  P.L. 115 -334) to extend expiring authorizations 
through September 30, 2024, and for the 2024 crop year.3  
The Farm, Food, and National Security Act of 2024 ( H.R. 8467 ) would add, amend, and 
reauthorize programs in the 2018 farm bill that would expire in 2024 without further legislative 
action. H.R. 8467  was introduced on May 21, 2024. The House Committee on Agriculture",

action. H.R. 8467  was introduced on May 21, 2024. The House Committee on Agriculture 
considered the bill and ordered it reported favorably to the House on May 23, 2024, by a vote of 
33-21. Du ring markup, Members considered 59 amendments  and adopted 25 (19 by en bloc).4 
Four amendments failed by recorded vote , eighteen  amendments were offered and withdrawn 
after some discussion , and twelve  amendments were not offered.  
The Senate Committee on A griculture, Nutrition, and Forestry has not released bill text for a farm 
bill. The majority released a summary and section -by-section for a bill on May 1, 2024.5 The 
minority similarly posted a framework on June 11, 2024.6 Neither release has legislativ e detail or 
completeness to compare with the bill in the House. No markup has been scheduled.  
This report provides a summary of each title included in H.R. 8467 , as ordered reported , using 
available information on the proposed legislation. As of the writing of this report, an amended

The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with Current Law  
 
Congressional Research Service   2 Service (CRS) relied on the introduced bill and adopted amendment text published by the House 
Committee on Agriculture.7 Following the summaries of each of the 12 titles included in  H.R. 
8467 , this report includes tables describing each provision in the bill and provides a direct 
comparison of these provisions to current law.  
Budgetary Impact  
When H.R. 8467  was marked up in committee, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had not 
released an official score, though the press had reported on preliminary scores for sections of the 
bill.8 Committees do not need a CBO score to mark up bills. Scor es are required for reported bills 
only before consideration on the chamber floor.9 On August 2, 2024, CBO published a score of 
H.R. 8467  “as ordered reported on May 23, 2024, and with subsequent amendments as provided 
by the House Committee on Agriculture on July 30, 2024 .”10 The score indicates that the bill 
would increase direct (mandatory) spending that is subject to budget enforcement, such as pay-as-
you-go (PAYGO) ,11 by $15.4 billion over five  years (FY2025 -FY2029) and by $33.0 billion over 
nine years (FY2025 -FY2033) compared with the May 2023 CBO baseline ( Table 1).12 
Budget Background for the Farm Bill  
Budget enforcement in Congress uses baseline and scoring procedures followed by the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) to determine whether proposed changes in a bill would increase or decrease government  
spending. The baseline  is a projection of what current law would cost if it were continued; it is a benchmark of 
assumptions about current economic conditions against which proposed changes in a bill are compared. The score 
is the effect that each provisi on, or the bill in total, is expected to have against the baseline ( CRS Report 98 -560, 
Baselines and Scorekeeping in the Federal Budget Process ).",

  0.15895805]","is the effect that each provisi on, or the bill in total, is expected to have against the baseline ( CRS Report 98 -560, 
Baselines and Scorekeeping in the Federal Budget Process ).  
A bill’s score may be grouped in various ways or subtotal ed by title, but it is the sum that determines whether it 
meets budget enforcement requirements, such as pay -as-you-go (PAYGO) or cut -as-you-go (CUTGO) ( CRS In 
Focus IF11032, Budgetary Decisionmaking in Co ngress ). PAYGO  refers to both a law and House and Senate rules that 
bills should not increase the deficit; essentially, that budgetary increases are fully offset by reductions so that the 
net score of a bill is zero ( CRS Report R41157, The Statutory Pay -As-You-Go Act of 2010: Summary and Legislative 
History ; CRS Report R47413, Points of Order in the Congressional Budget Process ; and CRS Report RL31943, Budget 
Enforcement Procedures: The Senate Pay -As-You-Go (PAYGO) Rule ). CUTGO  is a protocol in the House during the 118th 
Congress prohibiting offsets from having revenue -raising provi sions ( CRS Report R41510, House Rule XXI, Clause 
10: The CUTGO Rule ). 
Four titles of the farm bill account for over 99% of the baseline (nutrition, crop insurance, farm commodities, and 
conservation).  Budget laws require CBO to score proposed changes over a 10 -year budget window regardless of

The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with Current Law  
 
Congressional Research Service   3 the length of the authorization.  The current 10 -year baseline projection for FY2025 -FY2034 as of June 2024 is 
$1.36 trillion. The May 2023 baseline that CBO used to s core the bill was $1.46 trillion over FY2024 -FY2033 , or 
$1.32 trillion over the nine years FY2025 -FY2033 that are affected in  the score of H.R. 8467 . 
Recent farm bills have had posi tive, neutral, and negative scores: the 2002 farm bill added $75 billion to the 
baseline over 10 years, the 2014 farm bill reduced spending by $16 billion, and the 2008 and 2018 farm bills were 
budget neutral —adding spending to some programs using offsets from reductions to other programs ( CRS In 
Focus IF12233, Farm Bill Primer: Budget Dynamics ). The one -year extension of the 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 118 -22, 
Division B, §102) was budget neutral for programs with baseline and provided $177 million for one year for 19 
programs without a mandatory budget baseline by using an offset ( CRS In Focus IF12115, Farm Bill Primer: Programs 
Without Baseline Beyond FY2024 ). 
The CBO score for the farm commodity programs (Title I)  is an increase in projected payments  
(outlays)  of $47.0 billion over the nine years  FY2025 -FY2033 ( Table 1). The May 2023 baseline 
against which this was estimated was $67 billion over the nine years . This increase in esti mated  
cost would be partially offset by restricting the discretionary use of the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC), which CBO scored as a $3.6 billion reduction.13 Thus, the net cost of Title I 
is estimated  to be an increase in outlays of $43.4 billion over nine year s.  
Discretionary use of the CCC had not had any projected baseline until March 2020.14 The May",

Discretionary use of the CCC had not had any projected baseline until March 2020.14 The May 
2023 baseline estimated $9 billion of baseline for the nine years FY2025 -FY2033. The CBO 
score explains that the full $9 billion of baseline may not be realized  as savings. The House 
Agriculture Committee has argued that the offset should be valued higher, based on USDA’s past 
use of the authority from 2018 to 2023, and should completely  offset the title’s increase.15 
Baselines and scores, however, are forward -looking projections , which make s accounting for 
possible future administrative actions difficult.  
The CBO score of the conservation title (Title II) is an increase of the permanent baseline for 
farm bill conserv ation programs by $9.9 billion above the  May 2023  $55 billion nine -year 
baseline projection for FY2025 -FY2033. The increase would be more than offset by rescinding  
$11.7 billion of agricultural conservation funding under P.L. 117 -169 (referred to as the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA) that is available through FY2031. Thus, the net effect on 
agricultural conservation activities is a net reduction of $1.8 billion over nine years  (Table 1). 
The CBO score of the nutrition title (Title IV) shows an increase in some benefits totaling $10.1 
billion over the nine years F Y2025 -FY2033, but the title’s score does not include the offset in

The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with Current Law  
 
Congressional Research Service   4 CBO periodically updates the baseline projection for new economic conditions, which may affect 
new scoring estimates. CBO also advances the budget years that are projected on a rolling 10 -
year basis. The May 2023 ba seline that was used to score the House farm bill markup covered 
FY2024 -FY2033. The June 2024 baseline covers different years (i.e., FY2025 -FY2034) and 
would result in a different score if it were used —not only because of an additional year of costs 
(FY203 4) in a 10 -year window starting in FY2025 but also because of different assumptions 
about eligibility, prices , and the economy.

The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with Current Law  
 
Congressional Research Service   5 Title-by-Title Summary  
This section provides a brief narrative summary and key provisions of each title within  H.R. 
8467 . Within each title summary, a text box outlines the structure of each title and includes links 
to the respective subtitles in the side -by-side tables found later in this report.  
Title I, Commodities  
Title I of the farm bill authorizes  agricultural commod ity support  and disaster assistance 
programs. These programs provide income support to agricultural producers for certain natural 
disasters, adverse growing conditions, and/or low market prices. Commodity support is 
authorized for certain crops, dairy, and  sugar . Disaster assistance is available for a wide variety of 
crops and livestock. USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers these programs.  
H.R. 8467  would suspend non -expiring farm bill 
provisions from the 1930s and 1940s through crop y ear 
2029, amend and extend the commodity support 
programs from the 2018 farm bill through crop year 
2029, amend the permanently authorized agricultural 
disaster assistance programs, and restrict the Secretary 
of Agriculture’s use of CCC funds and authoriti es for 
FY2025 through FY2034 ( Table 2).16  
Commodity Policy  
The Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC), Price Loss 
Coverage (PLC), Marketing Assistance Loan ( MAL), and Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP) 
programs provide support to eligible producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, peanuts, 
and certain other commodities.17 The ARC program provides payments per base acre triggered by 
low average county revenue  relative to recent historical averages.18 The PLC program provides 
payments per base acre triggered by low average national prices relative to statutory reference 
prices.

Marketing Loans  
The MAL program provides nine -month loans to farmers collateralized by eligible stored 
commodities  and, along with the LDP  program, provides price support when market prices drop 
below statut ory levels .  
• MAL . H.R. 8467  would increase MAL rates by 117% for honey, 39% for wool,

The United States supports sugar producers by providing marketing loans to processors, limiting 
domestic sug ar supplies through marketing allotments to processors, and limiting sugar imports

allotments to sugar beet processors with available sugar supplies and reassign allotments by mid -
February each year.  H.R. 8467 , as ordered reported, does not include language reauthorizing 
flexible marketing allotments beyond 2024.  
H.R. 8467  would require USDA to determine which countries would not be able to fill their 
TRQs for the year and reallocate those quantities to other countries. This would require any 
reallocation of TRQs to increase sugar supply prior to April 1 to be based solely on addressing an 
“emergency U.S. shortage of sugar.” The bill would also require USDA to conduct a study on 
imported refined sugar and its impact on the domestic sugar indust ry. 
Dairy  
USDA supports milk producers through the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program.19 The DMC 
program pays participating producers the difference between a producer -selected guarantee and 
the national milk margin (all -milk price minus an average feed c ost ration). Margin payments are 
based on producers’ milk production history, not actual milk marketings. Producers pay annual 
premium rates based on two tiers of production history: Tier I premiums for 5 million or less 
pounds, and higher cost Tier II pre miums for more than 5 million pounds. H.R. 8467  would allow 
participating dairies to update production histories to the highest milk marketings for years 2021,

FMMO calculations of blended prices paid to milk producers. The bill would make the Dai ry 
Forward Pricing Program permanent .  
Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance Programs  
H.R. 8467  would increase payment rates for certain losses and expand eligible livestock  losses 
under the Livestock Indemnity Program. The bill would  lower eligibility criteria for the Tree 
Assistance Program and assign requirements for recipients. The bill would authorize USDA  to 
use block grants for administering supplemental ad hoc disaste r assistance .20  
Administration: Payment Limits and Eligibility Criteria  
H.R. 8467  would add new allowances for certain farm businesses to qualify for higher payment 
limits for ARC and PLC and for certain entities with average adjusted gross income (AGI) greater 
than $900,000 to qualify for disaster assistance and conservation programs.21 
Title II, Conservation  
Title II, Conservation, of H.R. 8467  contains reauthorizations, amendments, and new programs 
that would incentivize farmers and ranchers to voluntarily implement resource -conserving 
practices on private land.  The proposed changes in H.R. 8467  center on the C onservation Reserve 
Program  (CRP),  a new forest easement program, and funding ( Table 3). 
Conservation Reserve Program  
Under  H.R. 8467 , CRP, which provides federal payments to landowners to remove agricultura l 
land from production and restricts the conversion of grasslands to non -grazing uses, would be 
reauthorized at its current level of 27 million acres through FY2029. The program would be",

reauthorized at its current level of 27 million acres through FY2029. The program would be 
reorganized into four enrollment options: general, continuous, grassl and, and a new partnership 
initiative combining two existing CRP subprograms —the Conservation Reserve Enhancement 
Program and the State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement. Other CRP subprograms would be 
repealed, including the Farmable Wetlands Program, CLEAR3 0 (referencing the Clean Lakes, 
Estuaries, and Rivers initiative ), and the Soil Health and Income Protection Program Pilot. 
Several provisions would redefine CRP eligible land, which is currently based on erodibility, 
marginal pasture, as well as other res ource factors. The House -reported bill would tie land  
eligibility to a land capability classification system based on the suitability of soils for field crops. 
Other proposed changes relate to payment rate calculations, types of payments offered, and more 
flexible options to withdraw from the program.

Congressional Research Service   8 Environmental Quality Incentives Program  and Conservation Stewardship 
Program  
The two working land s programs —the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  (EQIP ) and 
the Conservation Stewardship Program  (CSP)—provide  technical and financial assista nce to 
farmers to improve land management practices. Most of the proposed amendments to EQIP and 
CSP would add emphasis on the use of precision 
agriculture practices and technology. The bill 
would create new subprograms and initiatives 
under both programs.  The bill would also use 
EQIP funding to pay for programs that had 
previously received stand -alone mandatory 
funding, including the V oluntary Public Access 
and Habitat Incentive Program  and the Feral 
Swine Eradication and Control Program . Both 
EQIP and CSP  would receive increased mandatory 
funding through FY2029 under  H.R. 8467 . 
Agricultural Conservation Easement 
Program  
The Agricultural Conservation Easement Program 
(ACEP ) provides financial and technical 
assistance through two types of easements: 
agricultural land easements that limit 
nonagricultural uses on productive farm or grasslands and wetland reserve easements that protect 
and restore wetlands. Most of the changes t o ACEP focus on additional incentives for socially 
disadvantaged farmer participation, the federal share of easement costs, and modification and 
exchange requirements. H.R. 8467  would increase mandatory funding for ACEP through 
FY2029.  
Forest Conservation Easement Program  
The bill would create a new Forest Conservation Easement Program (FCEP) that would fund two 
types of easements: forestland easements and forest reserve easements. Forestland easements 
would be similar to agricultural land easements under ACEP, protecting the sustainability of 
forestlands by limiting non -forest  land uses. Forest reserve easements would be similar to",

funding through FY2029.  
Nearly all of the conservation programs would receive increased mandatory funding under  H.R. 
8467 . This increase in funding authority would be offset by the repeal of supplemental funding 
provided to EQIP, CSP, ACEP, and  the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) in the 
2022 budget reconciliation (i.e., P.L. 117 -169, the IRA) . While the repealed IRA funding is

Congressional Research Service   9 Title III, Trade  
Title III addresses  U.S. international food aid and agricultural  trade programs. Under the farm bill 
authority, U.S. international food assistance is distribut ed through three main programs: (1) Title 
II of Food for Peace ( FFP Title II, emergency and nonemergency food a ssistance ); (2) Food for 
Progress (agricultural development programs); and (3) the McGovern -Dole International Food for 
Education and Child Nutri tion Program (school lunch and feeding programs). Traditionally, these 
three programs have relied on U.S. agricultural commodities for their activities. However, recent 
farm bills have increasingly added flexibility to purchase food in local markets or to directly 
transfer cash or vouchers to needy recipients. The U.S. Agency for International Development 
(USAID)  administers FFP Title II , and USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS)  administers 
the other two programs . 
H.R. 8467  would  reauthorize all int ernational food 
aid programs  (Table 4). FFP Title II would require 
USAID to consult with and receive approval from 
USDA for emergency food assistance, require the use 
of at least 50% of available funds to procure U.S. 
agricultural commodities and related ocean 
transportation on U.S. flagged vessels, narrow 
USAID’s authority to provide emergency food aid, and require the procurement of ready -to-use 
therap eutic foods for nonemergency food assistance under specified conditions of global child 
malnutrition.  
H.R. 8467  would extend authority for several other related international programs , including the 
Farmer -to-Farmer program, Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust  (BEHT) , and Global Crop 
Diversity Trust , and it would create the International Agriculture Cultural Immersion and

Market Development  (FMD)  Cooperator Program, the E (Kika) de la Garza Emerging Markets 
Program , and Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops.  These programs are under the umbrella of 
Agricultural Trade Promotion and Facilitation Program  and are administered by FAS. H.R. 8467  
would  increase annual mandatory CCC funding for MAP to $400 million (up from $200 million) 
and FMD to $69 million (up from $35.5 million) for FY2025 -FY2029. The bill would authorize

The 2024 Farm Bill: H.R. 8467 Compared with Current Law  
 
Congressional Research Service   10 Title IV, Nutrition  
The bill’s nutrition title would amend a variety of aspects of the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) and related nutrition assistance programs ( Table 5). Whi le the 
nutrition title contains nearly all of the policies related to programs administered by USDA’s Food 
and Nutrition Service (FNS), the bill’s  miscellaneous title (Title XII) also includes two major 
policy changes to SNAP and school meals programs (pro visions are summarized here but 
described in detail within Table 5 and Table 13). The bill generally would reauthorize SNAP and 
related programs for five  years through the end of 
FY2029. The summary, below, highlights some but 
not all of the Title IV provisions.  
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program  
H.R. 8467  would make amendments to SNAP 
eligibility and benefit calculation. It would exclude 
income earned by older youth (21 years of age and under as opposed to current law exclusi on of 
17 years and under) and income earned from a SNAP Employment and Training program (as well 
as additional specified workforce development programs). The workforce program income would 
be excluded from resources. The bill would raise the earned income deduction, further reducing 
the extent to which wages or self -employment income could reduce SNAP benefits. The bill 
would repeal the 1996 policy disqualifying individuals convicted of a drug -related felony from 
receiving SNAP. It would codify a demonstrat ion project to streamline access to SNAP for 
seniors and disabled participants without earned income. The bill would not change eligibility 
rules for students in higher education but would require USDA to issue guidance regarding 
outreach to certain studen ts who are likely to qualify.  Maximum monthly SNAP benefit 
allotments are tied to the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate , low-cost diet as measured by 
the USDA -created and -calculated TFP. The 2018 farm bill required a reevaluation of the TFP’s",

contents every five years. A provision in Title XII (miscellaneous title, §12401),  among other 
changes, would amend reevaluation of the TFP, no longer making reevaluations mandatory and 
adding constraints that would prevent USDA from reevaluating the market basket in a way that 
exceeds the cost of inflation.  
The bill includes changes to state administration of the program. Current law limits SNAP 
certification functions to state employees, but the bill would give states authority to contract out 
SNAP eligibil ity and referral functions under certain circumstances. The bill would provide 
further specifications to the National Accuracy Clearinghouse, the data system designed to 
identify and flag concurrent enrollment in multiple states, and require USDA to withdr aw and 
reissue regulations. For instances when states establish and collect claims against recipients for 
committing fraud, the bill would increase the percentage of recovered funds states retain. The bill 
would eliminate the quality control system’s error  tolerance threshold, making all errors, 
regardless of magnitude, count in the state and national payment error rates. The bill would no 
longer require states to data -match with the National Directory of New Hires for wage data 
information.  
The bill propos es changes to the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) and retailer policy. The bill 
would make permanent a bar on EBT fees for switching or routing SNAP benefits. It would 
prohibit store owners who are SNAP recipients from using their benefits at the stores  they own. 
The bill would make administrative processes around retailer penalties more extensive, providing 
more protections to penalized retailers.  With regard to tracking and potential theft of SNAP Side-by-Side Comparison

used exclusively for out -of-state purchases in a 90 -day period.  
The bill amends grants that are related to SNAP, such as nutrition education, bonus incentives, 
and territory programs in lieu of SNAP. The  bill wo uld make a number of changes to SNAP’s 
nutrition education program (SNAP -Ed, formally the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention 
Grant Program), including changes to program funding. It would also require relevant agencies to 
issue recommendations on u nifying SNAP -Ed with the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education 
Program (a National Institute of Food and Agricultur e [NIFA] administered nutrition education 
program). For Puerto Rico and American Samoa’s nutrition assistance block grants, the bill would 
increase annual mandatory funding by increasing base funding in FY2025 by approximately $103 
million over the FY2024  level . 
The Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) makes competitive grants for 
projects that incentivize SNAP purchases of fruits and vegetables or provide produce 
prescriptions for those with diet -related disease. H.R. 8467  would increase funding for the project 
grants by $19 million annually, reduce funds by $3 million annually for a related technical 
assistance center, and enable projects to provide all forms of fruits and v egetables (not limited to 
fresh). The bill would require steps toward moving GusNIP’s P roduce Prescription Program  from 
USDA to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  and sunset the produce 
prescription grants at the end of FY2029. For the Healthy Fluid Milk Incentives Projects, which

Food Distribution Programs  
The nutrition title of H.R. 8467  would reauthorize and amend the nutrition assistance programs 
that distribute USDA foods to  low-income households .  
With regard to tribal organizations’ operation of the Food Distribution Program on Indian 
Reservations (FDPIR) and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), the bill proposes

beyond the current limited demonstration project and would add new authority allowing tribal 
organizations under a self -determination contract to purchase CSFP foods instead of using USDA 
commodities. Relate dly, the bill would create a USDA office to administer tribal self -
determination contracts.  For CSFP in general, the bill would exclude some social security income 
from counting toward income eligibility and would authorize a competitive grant pilot progra m 
for home delivery projects.  
The bill would increase  The Emergency Food Assistance Program  (TEFAP ) funding by $5 
million (adjusted annually for inflation) and create a new option for Alaska, Hawaii, and certain 
U.S. territories to receive cash instead of USDA -purchased foods. It also would reauthorize  and

purchases from China.  
Title V, Credit  
Title V of H.R. 8467  would make changes to programs designed to increase access to agricultural 
credit, including USDA ’s FSA, the Fa rm Credit System (FCS), and Farmer Mac ( Table 6). FSA  is 
a small but important direct lender for family -sized farms that do not qualify for credit else where

lenders. Although FSA has a small share of the market compared with other lenders, it is an 
important lender for certain segments of the agricultur e industr y, such as beginning farmers and 
ranchers and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers . FCS is a private , cooperative  lender

including REAP, which does not expire with the 2018 farm bill.  
H.R. 8467  would reauthorize most o f the 
energy title programs and make 
modifications to selected programs ( Table 
10). Under the Biobased Markets Program, 
also known as the BioPreferred program, 
procuring agencies would be required to submit to both USDA and the Office of Federal 
Procurement Policy an annual report detailing actions the procuring agency has taken to establish 
and implement a biobased procurement program, the categories of  biobased products that are 
unavailable to meet the procurement needs of the procuring agency, and the desired performance 
characteristics for said products, among other things. For the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical, 
and Biobased Product Manufacturing As sistance Program, the bill would allow USDA to waive 
the demonstration of commercial viability when approving a loan guarantee application for the 
program. The bill would require a technical review agreement between USDA and the project 
applicant that outl ines certain objectives, outcomes, and conditions for USDA to determine the 
successful technical feasibility for the project. For REAP, the bill would amend the selection 
criteria to receive a grant and the award considerations to receive a loan guarantee or a grant to 
include the potential of the proposed program to meaningfully improve the financial conditions of 
agricultural producers or rural small businesses. The bill would repeal two programs: the 
Biodiesel Fuel Education Program and the Carbon Utiliz ation and Biogas Education Program.  
H.R. 8467 , in contrast to previous farm bills, would emphasize solar energy. The bill would 
require USDA to analyze the economic effects of solar panel installations on certain farmland, 
assess the impacts of shared solar energy and agricultural production on farmland, and assess the

assistance for a project that would result in the conversion of farmland for solar ene rgy 
production. Three exceptions to this prohibition would be permitted: projects converting less than 
five acres; projects converting less than 50 acres, with the majority of the energy produced used 
for on -farm use; and projects receiving approval or sup port from the county and municipality 
where the project is located. The bill would prohibit USDA from providing financial assistance 
for projects that procure solar energy components produced, manufactured, or assembled in a 
foreign country of concern; by an entity domiciled or controlled by a country of concern; or by a 
foreign entity of concern.30 
The bill supports the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)  and would modify the 
definition of advanced biofuel  to include SAF. H.R. 8467  would require USDA to establish a 
department -wide strategy to advance the production of SAF  that would  (1) facilitate the 
collaboration between relevant mission areas to encourage the advancemen t of the SAF supply 
chain ; (2) identify opportunities to maximize SAF development, deployment , and 
commercialization ; (3) leverage the capabilities of America’s farmers and others to capture 
opportunities in the SAF market ; (4) support rural economic devel opment through SAF 
production ; and (5) promote public -private partnerships for the development, deployment, and 
commercialization of SAF.

Congressional Research Service   18 Title X, Horticulture, Marketing, and Regulatory Reform  
Title X of H.R. 8467  would reauthorize many of the existing farm bill provisions supporting 
farming operations in the specialty crop sector, certified organic agriculture, local and urban 
foods sectors, and hemp cultivation. These provisions c over several programs and policies 
benefitting these sectors, including block grants to states, support for farmers ’ markets, data and 
information collection, education on food safety and biotechnology, organic certification , and 
other market development a nd regulatory initiatives. Provisions affecting the specialty crop and 
certified organic sectors are also contained within other bill titles, including in the research, 
nutrition, trade, and crop insurance titles.  
H.R. 8467  would increase available funding 
levels for certain specialty crop programs, 
including block grants to states and cooperative 
agreements for plant pest and disease 
management. The bill would increase available 
funding in the research title to address the 
development of mechanization and automation 
technologies for specialty crops. H.R. 8467  
would maintain support and existing funding 
levels for certified organic agriculture and 
certain local and urban agriculture programs. The bill  would establish an Office of Biotechnology 
Policy to coordinate USDA  policies and activities related to biotechn ology and create a pilot 
program for the intraorganizational movement of genetically engineered microorganisms.  
H.R. 8467  would add new and modify existing statutory definitions rel ated to hemp cultivation  
and its products and make changes to how hemp is regulated . It would add a new statutory 
definition of industrial hemp  to mean hemp grown for fiber or for the “whole grain, oil, cake, nut, 
hull, or any other non -cannabinoid compoun d, derivative, mixture, preparation, or manufacture of

8467  would redefine the existing statutory definition of hemp  (§1639o) by removing language 
basing the legal limits for hemp on its delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC) concentration and 
instead  would  base the definition on hemp ’s “total tetrahydrocannabi nol (including 
tetrahydrocannabinol acid  [THCA] ) concentration.”  Other statutory language regarding hemp 
“derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing 
or not ” would remain unchanged. H.R. 8467  (as amended) specifies that hemp  would exclude 
non-naturally occurring synthetic and intoxicating products (i.e., allows only naturally occurring 
or derived nonintoxicating products). It does not define intoxicating  but would prohibit hemp 
cannabinoid products  with “ quantifiable amounts ” of total THC (including THCA) or any other 
cannabinoids that have (or are marketed to have ) “similar effects  on humans or animals ” as THC 
as determined by USDA. The bill would add a defin ition of a  hemp cannabinoid product  that

approved labeling shall be permitted and considered lawful.  
Title XI, Crop Insurance  
The Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) offers subsidized crop insurance policies that 
producers can purchase for a wide variety of crops and livestock. Policies pay indemnities for 
yield and revenue losses from adverse growing and market conditions, including natural disasters. 
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), a government corporation withi n USDA, pays 
part of the premium (about 61% on average in crop year 2023), and policyholders —farmers and 
ranchers —pay the balance. Private insurance companies, known as “approved insurance 
providers” (AIPs), sell and service the policies in return for admi nistrative and operating (A&O) 
subsidies from the FCIC. The FCIC also reinsures a portion of AIPs’ underwriting risk as

to annually adjust caps limiting A&O subsidy payments on certain policies. The bill would 
impose new requirements on and grant AIPs additional recourse from USDA’s procedures to 
notify AIPs about errors, omissions, and failures to follow regulations or procedures. The bill 
would authorize AIPs to charge certain late fees to delinquent policyholders.

Includes  “[i]t is … the policy of Congress, in order to 
promote the general welfare, to safeguard the health

levels of nutrition among low -income households.” 
Finds  that limited food purchasing power contributed 
to hunger and malnutrition in low -income households 
and that increasing “utilization of food” also benefits 
the nation’s agricultural and marke ting industry. 
Authorizes SNAP to alleviate such hunger and 
malnutrition via increased purchasing power through 
normal channels of trade. The Fiscal Responsibility Act 
of 2023 (P.L. 118 -5, §313)  adds program purposes 
related to obtaining employment and increasing 
earnings. (7 U.S.C.  §2011)  Adds that Congress recognizes that SNAP allows low -
income households to obtain food that supports the 
prevention of diet -related chronic di sease (e.g., 
diabetes) , disability , premature death , unsustainable 
health care costs , and the undermining  of military 
readiness. Adds that it is the policy of Congress that 
USDA should administer SNAP in a manner that

Consolidated block grants for Puerto Rico and 
American Samoa. In lieu of participation in SNAP, 
Puerto Rico and American Samoa receive mandatory 
Nutrition Assistance Block Grant funding to provide 
food assistance in their juri sdiction s. The amount of 
funding is a FY2003 base of $1,401,000,000 adjusted 
each year for food inflation using the rate of change for 
the T FP. The funding amount is divided among the two 
jurisdictions: 99.6% for Puerto Rico and 0.4% for 
American Samoa. In  FY2024, the total amount provided 
was $2,942,100,000. (7 U.S.C. §2028 ; P.L. 118 -42) Increases the base funding to $3,045,758,000 in FY2025

ESAP waives the recertification interview requirement, 
allows for greater flexibility in verification, and extends 
the certification period to 36 months (usually 24

Agricultural foreign investment disclosure.  The 
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 
(AFIDA; P.L. 95 -460) requires disclosure by “any 
foreign person who acquires or transfers any interest, 
other than a security interest, in agricultural land” to 
USDA within 90 days af ter the date of such acquisition 
or transfer. Requires USDA to track this information 
and report data annually. Allows USDA to impose civil 
penalties for nondisclosure not to exceed 25% of the 
fair market value of the land. The FY2023 Consolidated 
Appropri ations Act ( P.L. 117 -328) further requires 
USDA to report on the impact of foreign investments 
in U.S. agricultural lands and requires USDA to 
establish a streamlined proce ss for electronic 
submission and retention of disclosures submitted 
under AFIDA, among other activities. (7 U.S.C.

Investment in the United States  (CFIUS) and provide 
CFIUS with information related to foreign ownership of 
U.S. agricultural land submitted to USDA under AFIDA.

Subtitle D – Other Miscellaneous Provisions  
Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) . Maximum monthly  
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (SNAP ) 
benefit allotments are tied to the cost of purchasing a 
nutritionally adequate low -cost diet, as measured by 
the USDA -created and -calculated TFP. This is a market 
basket of foods used as a basis for the cost of food and 
diet adequacy —the limited foods in  the theoretical 
basket are not limits on what SNAP benefits may 
purchase. The reference family of four people 
consisting of adults and children of certain ages is used ; 
from that reference , USDA is required to “make 
household -size adjustments (based on th e unrounded 
cost of such diets) using economies of scale.” Specific 
methodology is not in statute.  Requires USDA to follow specific ratios of the TFP 
reference family amount to determine maximum 
benefit amounts for all household sizes.  
The TFP cost is adjusted for food price inflation 
annually, each October, to reflect the cost of the TFP 
in the immediately previous June. The index of inflation 
is not specified in statute; USDA uses the Consumer 
Price Index for the categories of food included in the 
basket. Maximum allotments are standard across the 48 
contiguous states and the District of Columbia, but 
separate calculations are required for Alaska ( one 
urban version, two rural versions), Hawaii, Guam, and 
the Virgin Islands.  Requires USDA “to reflect ch anges in the Consumer 
Price Index for All Urban Consumers” in its annual 
inflationary adjustments. Amends TFP inflation for 
Hawaii to include separate urban and rural versions.

The 2018 farm bill ( P.L. 115 -334) required  USDA to 
reevaluate the contents of the TFP by 2022 and at five-
year intervals thereafter . USDA’s 2021 reevaluation for 
the contiguous states and  the District of Columbia  
(unlike reevaluations in 2006 and ea rlier) did not hold 
the cost of the new basket neutral , and benefits 
increased approximately $12 -$16 per person per 
month. An update to Hawaii’s T FP in 2023, using 
Honolulu data, resulted in a TFP lower than the plan in 
place in the contiguous states. (7 U.S.C. §2012(u); 
7 U.S.C. §2017(a); USDA,  Thrifty Food Plan, 
2021 , August 2021; USDA, Thrifty Food Plan Cost 
Estimates for Alaska and Hawaii , July 2023. ) Not earlier than October 1, 2027, and at intervals not 
more frequent than five years, gives USDA discretion 
to reevaluate the market baskets of the TFP. Prior to 
any update based on such a reevaluation, requires the 
methodology and results to be published in the  Federal 
Register  with a comment period of at least 60 days. 
Requires USDA to “not increase  the cost of the thrifty 
food plan based on [this] reevaluation or update.”
