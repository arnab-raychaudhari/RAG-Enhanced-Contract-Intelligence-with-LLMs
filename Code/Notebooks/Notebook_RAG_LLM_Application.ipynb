    "You are reviewing the source code for a web-based prototype tool designed to provide answers to user prompts with domain-specific contextual awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that facilitates intelligent document retrieval and natural language processing for large datasets. The framework supports users in querying specific applications, such as USA Spending and the Government Accountability Office (GAO), leveraging machine learning models (like Sentence Transformers) for document embeddings and ChromaDB for vector storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program has the flexibility to answer User Prompts in **Batch Mode** as well as in **Online Mode**. Batch mode is where someone- well versed with python code and technical understanding of the notebook- can prompt the application to generate contextually relevant and intelligent reponse. Online mode is for non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tProgram Execution Time Tracking: Measures start time for monitoring execution duration.\n",
    "\t2.\tLibrary and Package Imports: Loads essential libraries for data handling, text processing, and machine learning.\n",
    "\t3.\tRAG Setup:\n",
    "\t•\tAllows user selection between various language models (LLMs) and applications.\n",
    "\t•\tSets up the directory for raw document storage, imports documents, and structures text into chunks for embedding.\n",
    "\t•\tEmbeds the chunks using selected models and stores them in a persistent vector database (ChromaDB).\n",
    "\t4.\tDocument Retrieval:\n",
    "\t•\tUtilizes contextual retrievers and rerankers, which prioritize the most relevant chunks based on cosine similarity with user queries.\n",
    "\t•\tAllows option for enhanced contextual reranking for improved response relevance.\n",
    "\t5.\tQuery Embedding and Response Augmentation: Generates embeddings for user queries, retrieves relevant chunks, and formats responses augmented by context.\n",
    "\t6.\tInteractive Gradio Interface: Provides a user-friendly UI with options for selecting application, LLM model, and specific prompts. Also includes a ‘Chart It Up’ button to visualize responses when applicable.\n",
    "\t7.\tResponse Customization: Allows users to specify reranking, prompt emphasis, and unaugmented responses for testing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is designed for efficient querying and response generation by integrating document retrieval with LLMs, ideal for exploring large datasets and gaining insights into specific federal or organizational data points."
