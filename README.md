# RAGov-contract-analysis
Leveraging AI to Enhance Data Driven Insights for Government Contracts

## Project Introduction
This project was undertaken, executed, and completed as part of the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at George Washington University. As a requirement of the degree, I was tasked with partnering with a real-world business (my client) to address an ongoing problem using advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques. The project spanned four months and was successfully delivered to the client in December 2024.

## Executive Summary
FI Consulting faces a significant need for a reliable system capable of accurately retrieving and
synthesizing information from complex, unstructured documents to support high stakes decision
making in fields like legislative analysis, government procurement, and consulting. Traditional
large language models (LLMs), while advanced, often produce responses that seem plausible but
lack factual grounding, limiting their utility where accuracy is crucial. This project aims to address
these limitations by developing a proof-of-concept Insight Engine that leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. By combining LLM capabilities with retrieval
mechanisms, this system anchors responses in relevant, retrieved content, effectively reducing
ungrounded “hallucinations” and improving response accuracy and contextual reliability.

The Insight Engine is designed to deliver precise, real-time information, making it a scalable tool
adaptable to FI Consulting’s diverse needs. Its functionality extends beyond legislative and
contract analysis, allowing it to handle a broad range of unstructured data types, from policy
documents to complex financial reports. Initial testing demonstrated qualitative improvements in
response accuracy and relevance over standard LLM outputs, supporting the system’s value in
applications that require precision and dependability. Additionally, an interactive Gradio interface
provides users with a seamless, real-time experience, enabling them to explore grounded and
ungrounded responses side by side, enhancing both usability and transparency.

Although this project does not implement formal risk mitigation measures, the report outlines key
potential risks associated with deploying RAG and LLM systems, particularly in data sensitive
environments relevant to FI Consulting. These risks include considerations around data accuracy,
bias, and privacy, all of which are critical when utilizing AI driven systems in high stakes
applications. Recognizing these risks underscores the importance of responsible and ethical
deployment practices for the Insight Engine, should FI Consulting choose to scale the system.
Responsible deployment would involve establishing frameworks for ongoing monitoring, regular
audits, and secure data management. By acknowledging these potential challenges, the report
emphasizes the need for a cautious, ethical approach to the system’s future.
